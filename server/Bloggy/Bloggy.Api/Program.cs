For good reasons, we believe that church-related beliefs should not influence public education, unless the beliefs are part of a curriculum that involves the history or comparison of religions. With that in mind, and with our emphasis on educating the individual, it seems that concepts involving spirit are off limits in our schools. Similarly, in India, the cradle of so many spiritual traditions, there is a national interest in Values Education and an abhorrence of such a curriculum coming from any of India's many spiritual traditions. Colonial influences have left India as secular about education as the United States. This becomes important when we grasp that Values Education is a secular frame for millennia of spiritual traditions. The world's first cultures see the environmental and cultural genocide by colonial and post-colonial "commercial", evangelical, and industrial countries as symptomatic of a lack of spirit, a disharmony with the beauty, balance and consciousness of the earth. Reasonably, they suggest that our environmental 
and related crises are caused by human disharmony, or a lack of spirit, sensitivity, or we might say sympathetic, intuitive, and aesthetic resonance with the creation. Yet, ironically, our schools are all about spirit rallies. In these exercises of team spirit we use sports to light the torch of a collective belief and passion similar to nationalism during wartime. Thus, we might hypothesise that inspiring spirit, a collective purpose that inspires deep enthusiasm, in the service of sports is a healthy secular activity. But inspiring spirit, as a collective, unifying concept for the care of one another and the earth is not. It's time we took another look at the relationship between secular disciplines and spiritual teachings. While I'd argue for keeping specific religious teachings out of our schools, in the name of psychology, anthropology, comparative religions, team work, and shared purpose, I'd argue that to be fully human, which may be one good definition of being fully educated, people need to understand the towering spiritual traditions that teach to the heart of our humanity. Teaching such a balanced curriculum should NOT preach beliefs that come from any specific spiritual tradition. Indeed, by comparing these traditions, we can learn the common themes and divergences. We can also learn that many great people who were not within any religious tradition, held values in common with believers. Good and great people come clothed in widely varying spiritual and secular robes. Education should not be about maintaining ignorance about a core element in our nature--our joy in joining fully in events that quicken our sense of spirit. If people are not educated to the dangerous excesses of belief and spirit, as manipulated by authoritarians, then a secular education may leave people lonely and vulnerable rather than united and empowered to sympathetically serve our collective values, which are so similar across all spiritual and humanistic traditions.

Many people experience our unity with God and thus believe that a spiritual basis for Values Education (VE) is important. This paper suggests that a sense of unity can be achieved through cosmology, which means we can use science and the humanities to educate for a sense of unity. Science tells us that the universe is a unity of energy in time and perhaps beyond time. For example, all the water on earth, like all the elements and many molecules that make earth and life possible, came from a condensing cloud of fire and stardust. In all its forms, the core of all the matter on earth was created billions of years ago in dying stars. So the life-enabling water in our bodies and most if not all of the atoms is older than the earth. Every drop in oceans, rivers, lakes, and drinking fountains was born from cosmic explosions, as were all the elements in the periodic table. Thus, whether in the beginning was the word, or the thought of God, and we are created from God's consciousness, or whether in the beginning was cosmic energy, which by accident formed stars and made all life possible, either way, our existence is an unfathomable miracle, a great wonder, and our consciousness, at its best, is enchanted by our gift of being, whether that gift is gift-wrapped by God or a beautiful accident. Either way, here we are and we want to make the very best of it. We want to celebrate being alive and being with one another. And we want to celebrate the knowledge and wisdom that our ancestors have gifted to us through words, tools, attitudes and habits, passed like the first fire from generation to generation. The important question for VE is not whether we find our morality in unity with God's, for even if there were no God, there would still be unity. The unity would be in the fact that we are all the same miracles of time, sun, matter, and DNA, of tenderness and language. We all want to be cared for, respected and loved. We fear hunger, deceit, loneliness, and death. We all respond to kindness unless somehow we've been terribly wounded. We love to chatter with friends, to laugh, to see courage, kindness and beauty. So let us agree that God is NOT essential for everyone to justify Values Education. After all, many atheists are profoundly moral and many religious people have harmful values. Even if their God says thou shall not kill, they will stone their child if that child breaks a commandment, and they will say it is holy work to kill another who worships the same God, but in a slightly different way. This is not to suggest that God is not present and that God's presence is not the source of our quest for values. Let's simply agree that we do not have to find our unifying theme in God. It is enough to know that we all are of the same creation; made from the same energy, have the same hopes and fears, and all hunger for recognition, kindness, support, fun and tenderness. Thus, we can say that the basis of VE is our unity with each other and with each grain of sand, seed, flower, bee, tear, sunbeam and smile. All exist, products of one-cosmology, one-galaxy and solar system, one-biology and ecology, one-social and cultural continuum. That is a great deal to have in common. Once we sense our unity, then we are drawn to treat the world and others as we wish to be treated. But to be consistently kind, we must develop our awareness by observing that many times our minds and hearts are divided and we are not kind to others or ourselves. 
We are ambivalent or worse—very judgmental, very cruel. We gossip and bully, ignore, threaten and hurt others. What we fail to see is that our cruelty, our judgmental thinking and behavior then casts a rejecting, angry shadow back on us, or actually originates within a rejecting shadow within us, a shadow that we carry. This is why both spiritual and secular traditions in religion and in psychology teach us to witness or be mindful without judging. We are advised to heal the division in our minds and hearts, to heal the divisiveness in our attitudes so we will NOT nourish this fragmentation, and then unconsciously turn it against ourselves. In mindfulness or witnessing we are taught to let our minds become like a clear stream, to let all our thoughts and feelings be like fish that swim through. Just as the stream does NOT hold onto the fish, so our egos, or our consciousness, should NOT hold on to what is good or bad because if we hold on, then the mind is stopped from the perfect stillness that flows, and we stop growing, stop expanding our awareness, stop achieving an ever more subtle appreciation for the creation that flows within us and outside of us—making us and every moment possible. Thus, the important thing for VE may not be a unity based on spiritual beliefs, but simply a sense of the unity of creation, and our gift of awareness that enables us to know that unity, and to then feel our responsibility for the creation and for each of the creatures and things in it. Nature is the unity in the world from which life springs, so when we let ourselves be at one with nature, we sense this unity and we sense our instinct to be stewards, caretakers of nature, just as we have an instinct to be caretakers for one another. The challenge of living in such unity is to accept ourselves with all of our fears, impulses, destructive and selfish habits. We must learn to see that we make ourselves superior by making someone else inferior. We are better because we are richer, stronger, smarter, taller, tougher, smaller, prettier, younger or older. All these ideas of specialness hurt us because they divide us first within ourselves, and then from others. In this division our insecurity is expressed, and so too our careless, thoughtless, and destructive behavior—as if we want to prove that we don't have to care because if we care then we too are vulnerable and must have compassion born of not yet realized self-acceptance or self-love. Our secular world's emphasis on specialness is the opposite of cultivating humility. For it is in being special like everyone else, or in our commonness, in our sense of community, in our caring and communication, that we find our unity. The seed of our most caring consciousness is born in our sense of others, and of equality. This has profound implications for how we design and explore all learning. We see that we do not want to divide or fragment people as we teach for assessments. This of course occurs when students study for competitive tests. Further, we do not want to divide the world into disconnected subjects and facts, because such division destroys the teacher's and learner's sense of unity that spurs curiosity, exploration, and wonder. Instead, we want to discover how all things are related, interacting, sustaining, and creating. Hummingbirds, snakes, snails, and whales, we need to know that we all sip the same ancient water and inhale the same leaf-green air while living our shared DNA guided lives. We are naturally curious and each sincerely asked question nourishes new questions. We are greatly enriched when we discover the miracles of how water and oxygen are formed and forever refreshed, how butterflies, salmon, lobsters, and swans migrate, and how DNA changes gills into lungs, scales into feathers and skin. We also want to enable people to discover how the mind that is relaxed and focused sees clearly, so art, play, building, learning, communicating and caring, nourish compassion unified in the unfathomable, and very likely, Godly beauty of being.

Political, philanthropic, and educational decision makers want to measure what software is used, and to what effect, to guide (control) technology purchases. But this common sense interest raises common sense concerns. We have observed unintended consequences: in the name of accountability, educational systems become more top-down, standardized, sterile, didactic, redundant and irrelevant. Since digital systems have the advantage (and disadvantage) of easily facilitating measurement of learning, there is a danger that this ability to generate use and effects data for decision makers may push us toward curriculum designs and learning experiences that are immediately measurable. Such a curriculum would continue the unfortunate tradition of covering content at the expense of discovering and applying powerful, fascinating, and beautiful ideas. By standardizing curriculum to focus on accountability, we often cause teachers and students to feel that they are the means to bureaucratic ends—with higher test scores reflecting a cost-benefit. But we know from experience, management, and learning sciences that people learn, work, problem solve, and grow most happily and efficiently when they are not subject to tasks that are purposefully aligned to performance reviews. The danger, then, is that education would become a series of smarter digital interactions, more efficient in conveying set information and providing practice in set thinking procedures to meet preset measurable objectives. Where the systems are digital and adaptive, we call them personalized. But such systems may further make knowledge more extrinsic, rather than intrinsic; devoid of a felt sense of purpose. The price we pay for our well-intentioned obsession with accountability is that education is reduced to consuming measurable modules. This exacts a price. We retreat from exploring and creating interactions that facilitate important dimensions for human development. These dimensions focus on self-knowledge and happiness—trust, curiosity, questioning, initiative, identity, purpose, ethical behavior, service, stewardship, self-expression, and collaboration. This kind of learning emerges from a felt sense of personal, social, economic, intellectual or aesthetic purpose. It improves as a function of community and transcends most textbooks or formal curricula, though textbooks and lectures can be integrated into such learner-focused experiences. A very different way of looking at digital systems has an enormous role to play in creating these kinds of personal, community, and project-based learning experiences, even though our science of measurement and accountability has not caught up with these more open and human approaches. This more openly personal and social alternative views the computer not as the medium of delivery, feedback, and accountability; instead, the digital systems become mediums for facilitating social interactions (matching people by compatibility or complementary skills), providing facile means for communication about ideas and curriculum designs; identifying problems and opportunities, and storing a working history. Where in one case the technology is used to close the system, in the other it is used to open it to human concerns and creativity. In time, this kind of open design and publishing medium naturally facilitates a focus on improvement, on adapting content presentations and interactions for ever more diverse populations of students and teachers. In a diverse and multicultural society like the United States, the value of facilitating these capacities is beyond the bounds of measurement. Digital textbooks transformed into adaptive learning systems are here to stay, but we definitely want to build complementary digital systems. One excellent way to do this is to use technology to support schools and classrooms as Research & Design Studios, as Labs and Learning Communities. Education within Learning & Design Communities is very different from education as pre-established/machine-adapted content and tested teaching and learning. Where technology is used to facilitate Community Design and Learning, we can facilitate the creative problem-solving and culture-making processes in people. Inquiry becomes purposeful, communication sensitive, efficient, aesthetically pleasing and powerful. The outcome is building something new and/or evolving something old. This is problem-solving by design and building. It is STEM and STEAM transformed from academically taught disciplines to relevant problem-solving that combines purposeful work and learning. When knowledge is applied to make the world a better place, at least for one other person, academics can become an important part of giving people an enhanced 
sense of power, pride and identity. When people gain the power of belonging to a compatible group with shared purpose and effort, the results for all involved increase dramatically. The challenge for our technology/education communities is to NOT cut off our human communities—which already are far too isolated from our schools. On the contrary, we have to discover how to use our technology to facilitate warmer, richer, more meaningful learning, work and design communities in and around our classrooms. This will benefit education, and it will benefit our communities whose at-heart purpose is the protection and development of the next generation. Education needs the same urgency that we see in ants carrying their eggs from a disturbed nest. We should work to create better fitting and inspiring mentor relationships (face-to-face and virtual, local and global) for students and teachers. We should employ our technology to build and facilitate ever more inspired and talented curriculum designs processes enhanced by cross-discipline teams. We should build an infrastructure for facilitating learning by working in apprenticeship situation and in service and stewardship teams in our communities. Great gains can also be made in research if we view technology's measurement capacities in system-wide ways. Instead of thinking in terms of the normal curve in response to manipulating one or a very few variables, we can think in terms of the diversity of students and the multiple factors affecting where they are on that curve. Thus we can greatly refine our definition of experimental and control groups, and how we analyze the data coming from each. This means that many researchers can use the same parameters (data sets) and we can begin to drill down to N of one understanding. Ultimately we will discover that we can design unobtrusive and transferable data gathering systems to support system-wide research that provides insights into the diversity of students' in terms of their learning within online and off-line contexts. One use of technology is not necessarily better than the other. The adaptive learning and other delivery mediums serve important purposes. But that delivery process, because it more readily fits accountability measures, should not outweigh using technology to deepen our design, research, and service communities that are rooted in human interactions that technology now can facilitate. Our research should shine light on how to refine both systems to meet people's deepest needs—the needs of different types of students and teachers at different stages, in different contexts, and learning for different places for different purposes. Ultimately, we need to act from the knowledge that there are two common cores. The current academic curriculum should be viewed as second, or as developing in parallel with the first common core, which is Self-Knowledge and Social Emotional Learning. Ironically, by placing academics ahead of self-knowledge, and even ignoring self-knowledge, we have put academic learning in jeopardy, particularly for our most at-risk and gifted students. Thus, our current curriculum is not very successful at inspiring students and teachers to realize the richness of their individual and collective histories and cultures or their uniquely unfolding selves. This means we should use technology to help us redesign the Academic Common Core in two ways. One by machine delivered interactions. The other by computer facilitated human interactions that promote both self and academic learning. In other words, technology will realize its potential when Learning, Design, and Research Communities organize stakeholders around continuously improving their learning through all kinds of technology and human mediated interactions. Self-knowledge, or The First Common Core, naturally has to be much more personalized. This is the Common Core of self-awareness, introspection, and self-regulation built from the idiosyncratic processes of discovering and expressing one's self. It develops through and expresses identity. It is well exemplified by people like Socrates, van Gogh, and Thoreau, and by our best business, science, political, spiritual and artistic leaders. Its principles are well documented in developmental psychology. These two systems, the Personal Introspective/Purposeful Social and Creative and the Academic/Technical are not separate. Each, if well designed, should nourish the other, and either without the other will perpetuate a dangerously failed education system. A sound-working hypothesis may be that when the Common Core reflects the best of our cultural knowledge, which is an amazing legacy, we will see a coming together between self-and cultural and academic knowledge. Then we will know that we are building a great curriculum—a great learning community for human, social and economic development. But the further apart self and academic-cultural knowledge remain, the more we know our educational designs are failing our human and societal potential, and that measuring what's most successful in a failing system perpetuates failure and unhappiness—especially if accountability measures are so sterile as to ignore teacher and learner purpose, identity, and happiness. Political, philanthropic, business, and administrative leaders will want to tread lightly when considering narrowing our human potential by reducing education to what publishers and technologists can monetize and the Internet can readily deliver, adapt and measure. They also will want to consider the exciting, subtle and profound ways to use technology to rebalance education by deepening the capacities and insights that technology can help us to facilitate in communities devoted to service, stewardship, design, problem solving, and research.

Throughout history, wise individuals have taught that learning is about inspiring a passion, not merely filling a void. True education manifests as love, leading to community service, with self-knowledge, compassion, imagination, and agency as core capacities applied within a meaningful context that fosters just-in-context learning. Unfortunately, our narrow academic traditions, focused on measurable returns, have too often confined education to dehumanizing learning and assessment processes. However, the deepening synergy between learning and computer sciences offers a solution: integrating measurable education outcomes with holistic human development through AI-supported portfolio assessments. While linear digital systems will still facilitate alignment between curriculum and learning measurements, we no longer need to prioritize standardized curricula or summative accountability over self-knowledge, creativity, personal growth, service, and project-based learning. Using Portfolios for assessment, we can expand our learning and assessment model to provide both measurable content delivery and foster personal growth while capturing measurable growth in all areas. Technology should be harnessed to create community-based learning environments that complement and integrate existing curriculum areas. Classrooms should evolve into studios for learning, design, and assessment. Here, students and teachers can engage with other talented people in meaningful, purposeful experiences that merge personal development with academic achievement. By integrating learning and computer sciences, we can transcend the limitations of traditional education by supporting all forms of learning and using technology to unlock deep and unique human potentials through more sophisticated research and more engaging and creative assessment processes.

As AI refines the Internet, education can integrate curriculum and assessment with learning and computer sciences. The AI-enhanced Internet can create a bottom-up and top-down, new technology and design infrastructure to personalize learning. Global learning cultures can enrich local, and local cultures can refine global. Crowd-sourced, continuously improving, integrated open-source curriculum and assessment resources can replace traditional ‘teach to the test’ products. As local schools become curriculum design and assessment studios (STEAM enterprises), resources and practices to meet diverse needs will evolve, and assessment will become problem-solving oriented and enriching. To initiate this, an education R&D enterprise needs to support curriculum curation through smart searches, bottom-up authoring with continuous improvement, assessment, and HR matching. We might focus on 4 tools: • Curriculum Curation / Search • Curriculum Design and Adaptation • Assessment • Local ⬄ Global Human Resource Learning Communities
Four Tools Described:
Curriculum Curation
An AI Education Search Engine will help educators curate developmentally sequenced curricula. It will suggest digital and non-digital local to global resources to enhance learning processes across and among disciplines. It will recommend learning support resources according to what is known about the learner and the local and global resources available to her. This technology will scaffold and integrate learning experiences and personalize it for students’ developmental needs and teachers’ teaching styles.
Curriculum Design and Adaptation
Combining the AI Education Search Engine with curriculum authoring tools will support developing crowd-sourced, continuously improving curricula that are based on original content and adaptations to meet diverse learner and teacher needs. Supported by ePortfolio learner assessments, curriculum design will be refined by feedback systems making design responsive to learner and facilitator needs.
Assessment
e-Portfolios will enable students to reflect on their engagement, successes, and challenges. This centers assessment on student agency (executive function) and provides personalized metrics. Formative self-assessment improves learning while generating data to measure growth. Portfolio information includes goals/purposes, progress, frustrations, successes, questions, next steps, help needed, and where to find help. ePortfolio assessments will be shared in a personalized support network. People and AI will annotate reports and provide encouragement and feedback. Always formative and summative, these assessments focus on learner insight, literacy, agency, initiative, and problem-solving. These processes bring SEL, STEM, STEAM, and PBL (Project-Based Learning) to life with actionable information to personalize the curriculum, learning processes, and social and learning interactions. Portfolio assessment ends the need for expensive, judgmental, summative assessments that homogenize and narrow the curriculum into one size fits all, siloed, sliced, and diced activities, even as rhetoric and ideals call for integrated, personalized learning.
Local to Global Human Resources Community
Everyone can be part of the Smart HR Pool and can play multiple roles in cross-age, cross-capacities, cross-maturity, and interest groups. Teachers and students can be matched for compatibility, and the success of these matchings can be tracked in e-Portfolios. Students are placed in fitting study, tutoring, club, and other groups to increase engagement, belonging, and success. These meetings can be recorded for quality and safety and analyzed by AI. Students and groups can use e-Portfolios to provide real-time feedback to improve interactions and offer suggestions.

        I have a hobby and it’s weird.
        It started in a pretty normal way.
        I’d always liked taking walks and then I had young kids.
        Because it was often the only way I could get them to sleep–or to keep them out of the house so my wife could sleep–I would spend hours and hours walking on the rural country road that we live on.
        It is unpaved and unmaintained by the county or the state, lined with trees, and more frequently crossed by deer and jack rabbits than people. We’d do miles and miles, first in the baby bjorn, then the single stroller and then the double stroller. We see the sun come up or the sun go down. We crunch the frost and the mud. We’d do it in the heat and the cold, on ordinary days, for the interminable months of the pandemic, weekdays and weekends, rain or shine.
        It’s a throwback to an older, simpler way of life.
        It’s also a throwback to a scene I’ve always remembered from Mad Men, where Don Draper and his family finish their roadside picnic and then nonchalantly throw all their trash into the grass below.
        Only out here, because the police don’t seem to mind or our local government is non-existence, they dump tires and old mattresses. They dump debris from construction sites. They dump beer bottles and candy wrappers. They dump out of season deer kills and for some inexplicable and alarming reason, a lot of dead dogs. At first, this just pissed me off — especially because the nails kept giving me flats. It would make whole segments of the road unwalkable with the kids because of the stench. I tried calling the police and animal control and my local politicians — of course, they did nothing. I put up fake cameras which did nothing to deter. I thought about moving. Does it make a difference? In the big scheme of things, no. Does it create a moral hazard? Maybe. Perhaps word has gotten out — dump your stuff down here because it mysteriously disappears a few days later.
        But then one morning on my walk with my kids, a thought hit me that was both freeing and indicting. How many times do I have to walk past this litter, I thought, before I am complicit in its existence? Why do I keep expecting someone else to do something about it if I won’t? So I started cleaning it up…and I actually enjoyed it. We started cleaning it up.
        I have a bag, one of those sticks with a spike on it, and I go up and down the country roads where we live. I have a claw and gloves (I have gone through many many pairs of gloves). I go down in the gullies by the side of the road picking up soda bottles, plastic bags, food wrappers, nails, and screws. I have disposed of dumpsters worth of garbage over the years. I have loaded tires into the back of my truck and paid to have them properly recycled. (I’ve even paid a contractor to come out with a tractor for some particularly heavy stuff). I have put on face masks and scooped up dead goats, dead calves and dead dogs which I burned or took to the back of my ranch to decompose in a less disruptive place. I have paid my children an ungodly amount of bribes to get them to participate too.
        I don’t just do it at home either. I do it when we go to the beach. I do it when we go on hikes. I do it when I’m pacing in a parking lot, taking a phone call. I think I’d want someone to grab this if they saw it, so I’ll do the same. I’m not sure my neighbors have noticed. In fact, one time, as I loaded up a mattress in my truck, someone who lives down the road accosted me, thinking I was the dumper. Honestly, the only time anyone has ever said thanks happened in another country. I was in Greece this summer and I passed a flattened water bottle in the street, which I reached down and grabbed and tossed in a nearby trash can. An old man sitting in a cafe stood up and began clapping and bowing and shouting in unintelligible Greek. I assume he was saying thanks, but maybe he was making fun of me.
        I’ll tell you it doesn’t earn you karma, not at least during this lifetime. Despite all the work my wife and I still get a flat tire every month or so.
        But that’s not why I do it.
        I do it for me.
        In a world where everything seems to be falling apart and so much is beyond my control, there is something deeply empowering about this simple, weird act. I can see the difference every time I drive home — the road is cleaner, safer, more beautiful. I’m outside instead of stewing indoors. I’m moving instead of scrolling. I’m solving a problem instead of complaining about it.
        There is a Mr. Rogers quote I love. “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news,” Rogers said, “my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’”
        We decide what we look for in life — do we get mad at the people making the mess or do we look towards the people cleaning things up? We decide whether to despair or find hope and goodness.
        But I actually think we can go further. Do we decide to BE one of the helpers? Do we decide to pick up the trash? Do we take ownership of the things within our control?
        That’s what makes the difference…and life better for everyone, but especially you.

To date, scaling educational reform has failed because we have been limited by our beliefs, models, and technology. Thanks to the wealth of human, cultural, and technological resources, the 21st century can be about reinventing the culture of human development and learning so schooling becomes a joy rather than a chore for students and teachers. With a sufficiently vital focus on student and teacher diversity, STEAM has the potential to broaden and deepen our educational thinking, design, and practice in ways that positively change resource design, teaching, and learning. However, to implement STEAM well, we must move out of cubicles and into classrooms. We must open classrooms to communities of people & nature, and communities to classrooms. We must stop thinking institutionally and begin thinking culturally, developmentally, and psychologically. We must grasp that meeting people's social-emotional (SEL) needs is the first step to human development and learning. Since learning builds on background knowledge and opportunities for self-expression, we must discover where learners are and meet them there. A person who can't float is not ready to learn to swim. The kinds of changes required to inspire and make the kinds of changes called for in the educational system would be unthinkable without current technology and our current sciences of learning, personality, culture, management, family & community. So, let's build a 21st Century model for creating a new ecology for human development, schooling & learning. Let's imagine 4 pillars that will hold the ecology up. What we immediately see when we look at these 4 Pillars is that we have moved from either/or thinking to INCLUSIVE, and thinking. This is essential to build a complete model and pedagogy that is sensitive to diversity and the common and idiosyncratic dimensions of human development and learning. The 4 pillars: 1. Self-knowledge is the beginning and end of social-emotional learning, successful adjustment, productivity, and the pursuit of happiness. Self-knowledge is the common-core of identity and a royal road into the wonderfully weird world of diversity, learning, creativity, and productivity. 2. Family, community, natural, cultural, and expert resources are the matrix out of which self and all other knowledge grow. Expert resources are included because, while experts are part of communities and are carriers of cultural resources, they are leaders who inspire us for efficient learning and the development of identity. 3. Online cultural + community + design + research + feedback resources are included as parallel elements to #2 because without the internet and knowledge engineering, we would not be able to consider how to coordinate so many different elements. It is precisely our ability to engineer all the components in #2 that 
creates the potential for us to take community organization within a human, cultural, and natural resource environment to a new level that enables us to deploy all of these resources in the service of human development. 4. Flexible, personalized, developmentally sensitive common core curriculum is now possible if we realize the wealth of our human, cultural, and natural resources as the vectors for designing our new common core. This common core should focus on problem-solving that facilitates service and stewardship to our families, communities, and nature. Please note that the goal that was first in school reform, the academic common core, is now 4th, because developmentally this is where it belongs. Why? Because, in general, we grow cognitively healthy where we are socially and emotionally supported. The stimulation for that growth comes out of the natural and social matrix that nourishes us; it comes out of the ways in which the culture designs the knowledge-gaining experiences to make them accessible and meaningful. Assessment is not the goal of learning; productivity in creating, sharing, and problem-solving is what motivates us to learn and work. Assessment is simply a part of the work/learning process that functions best when it supports insight and refinement. Thus, we should be talking about personalized development rather than just personalized learning.

I was a very poor student. I was in the lowest reading group in a blue-collar community. My mother was a reading specialist, and my older brother was an academic genius. I was fast on the playground and slow in the classroom. Since I was born to Jewish parents at the beginning of WWII, it was painfully clear that the world was crazy. By age eleven, I knew I wanted to help heal our hurting world. When I heard Freud knew why the world was crazy, I wanted to become a psychoanalyst. Instead, I became a psychotherapist and studied community mental health, curriculum design, and English.
By accident, while in graduate school at UCLA, I wrote what became a somewhat popular children’s book. It was called Beautiful Junk, A Story of the Watts Towers. That book, without my knowing it, was to become both Bible and Blueprint for my life. It was about a black boy who travels from breaking things in anger to finding beauty and creating things from what is broken. But to move from anger to love, he has to climb the fence that holds him in school.
That story brought me into classrooms as an author, and later as a writer-in-residence. Around that time I co-founded the Community Design Studio at the Southern California Institute of Architecture. The premise was that design is an inside job inspired by being on-site or in-residence, not by sitting in a cubicle at a drafting table. I also taught the psychology of design, which involved thinking about how intuition joins cognition to bring forth the best possible form and function, aesthetics and utility. It was the book, Beautiful Junk, that led a Foundation to provide seed money to bring other artists into an inner-city Los Angeles School. Together we created a design studio to work on curriculum. This was known as The Artist-in-Residence Reading Project.
From the Artist-in-Residence Reading Project, I learned that children are unbelievably beautiful, and pure when they are in their early grades, but by grade four, in the inner city, we begin to lose far too many children. I learned that to become mentally healthy, a person has to discover their voice and choice and to connect these to the symbol-making process. I learned that we are social animals, and that our didactic, shallowly academic curriculum stifles everyone’s social and expressive needs. I learned that the artists were able to light beautiful fires in classrooms and the teachers, with all good intentions, too often were persistent in stifling those fires. Finally, I learned that our team of artists was profoundly inspired by the children, and by the more open teachers. The artists got as much from being in the project as the children. That was an effect I had not anticipated.
A Humanistic Approach to Teaching Science.
I am inspired by the arts, science, and emerging technology. Science is the art and discipline of observing, caring, wondering, and asking questions in order to explore and discover. Science looks to go more deeply into the design of the creation. Science asks how the world works, how people function. What is most important within a given context.
Science is also the source of so much that we value in our culture. Science has made engineering at current levels possible. That engineering is now driving science, which in turn is improving our potential to avoid and treat diseases, process and communicate information, and discover the nature of the society and the universe — pushing our knowledge to ever more subtle levels that stimulate more questions, more inquiry and reflection, more measurement-based observation, and fertile uncertainty.
At heart, science is curiosity stimulated by observation, hypotheses joined to experimentation. It is wonderfully rational and incredibly intuitive and productive. The best in our society is a product of science joined to technology. And, of course, both science and technology are profoundly influenced by mathematical insights.
But science without aesthetics, without idiosyncratic inquiry, without personal symbol making, which art is largely about, risks becoming sterile. Where scientific inquiry is motivated by objective questions, objective observations, usually about the outer world, artistic inquiry is more motivated by a quest for self- or at least expressive knowledge. Artists experiment in self-expression, in finding their unique voice, in gaining insight into the unfathomable depths of being in this place with these people and with nature.
Both the Arts and Sciences are motivated by curiosity and inspired observation and pursued through focus and discipline, but they explore different realms. In the end, the arts document our struggle to achieve our sanity and humanity. The sciences pursue more objective knowledge of the creation.
That said, science can turn the light of its tools onto patterns in human intelligence, intuition, and so on. And the arts can provide an intuitive view of the horizons where objective knowledge dissolves into subjective awe and wonder.
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) provides the methods and tools to bring public education into the 21st Century in the very best sense. Personalised Learning can now realise its potential if we apply the sciences of management, learning, personality development, and diversity to how we design, diversify, and then publish our curriculum. We should be equally interested in teacher diversity and personalised staff development. This is a whole new field of Research, Development and Design.
Our current technology provides an unbelievable curriculum design environment, whether we’re designing for on or off-screen learning, and it has inherent within it entirely new research potentials that span all the factors that both inspire and limit our learning.
Finding the Right Balance What is the relationship between the Arts and STEM as relates to education? The Arts are a somewhat different form of inquiry and their expression is tuned to communication. What the arts offer to curriculum design is sensitivity to aesthetics, and aesthetics are the velcro that helps ideas to stick. So, when I think about forming a curriculum design team, I want to see lots of fine scientists and researchers, joined by artists, working together with software engineers.
I’m much less interested in the “application of STEM content” than in figuring out how schools begin to function as STEM studios, workshops, or laboratories. The classrooms are where the students and teachers are. This is where the design action is.
The best learning is immersive, not didactic. Content teaching tends to be dreadfully and redundantly didactic, though gifted presenters provide a wonderful exception as do productions by great media artists.
Being part of a research team, doing an R&D project with scientists, and designing curriculum by working with designers, that is an immersive and creative experience. STEM is to be lived, it’s an approach to life and a new kind of culture for our schools. STEM is not just to be learned about, it’s to be lived.
Having said that, we should do a much better job providing a curriculum that tells the amazing story of the history of science and technology in medicine, engineering, transportation, manufacturing, business, knowledge transfer (publishing), and so on. And we should tell the story of the main themes in cultural and human development.
The biographies of great physical and social scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and other people who have contributed to our culture should be well understood by students and their teachers. Our culture is lifted by their vision and dedication.
Thinking About Diversity in Our Teaching
Diversity is one of the great mysteries of the universe (uni-verse means one poem or song) because no two people are ever entirely alike nor are contexts ever repeated exactly. The Latin ideal on our national seal says “Unity Through Diversity.”
But diversity is not easily perceived because our egos tend to think everyone else is pretty much like us and we’ve been here before. We have trouble getting quiet enough to make room for people who are very different from ourselves and for new moments. It may well be that perceiving human diversity much more deeply is one of the frontier challenges we now face. Certainly, educating for diversity is a frontier challenge for school reform.
And here is where joining STEM with the Arts associated (STEAM) with great curriculum design is so important. Technology now makes it possible for us to do amazing research about diversity as it relates to learning, motivation, and our social and other drives. If we are serious about achieving personalised learning, we need to build that personalised learning on research into diversity. Prior to computer science, there was no way to operationalize this kind of research and then design and publish curriculum in response to the continuously evolving results.
However, I’m afraid that STEM in our schools has fallen far short of its potential because we have seen it as a subject, or set of subjects to teach, while failing to apply STEM to our teaching and learning, curriculum design, and assessment processes.
Ironically, while loudly declaring that education should be research-based, we continue to ignore the learning, management, and human development research while turning STEAM and SEL into subjects taught from textbooks and uninspired lectures in preparation for tests that serve a stupefying accountability.
When will we rise above the entropy of current practices and begin to learn and celebrate the benefits of inventing our knowledge culture?

In the quest to prepare students for a future filled with jobs that don't yet exist, we often emphasize critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration—skills that are vital for success in a rapidly evolving world. However, these skills are not independent of one another. They all rest on a foundational hub: self-knowledge. The question, then, is how can we design a curriculum that helps students develop a deep sense of self-awareness, which is the starting point for cultivating critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration?
The growing focus on Social Emotional Intelligence (SEI) represents a significant first step. SEI looks beyond the traditional academic focus on civics and good citizenship, helping students explore their own ever-evolving nature. This kind of learning has deep roots in humanistic traditions designed to foster self-knowledge—an awareness of one’s thoughts, emotions, motivations, and social interactions. But how can we fully realize this potential in our classrooms?
To evolve a curriculum for developing self-knowledge, we need to ask: What principles, concepts, and practices can help students cultivate self-awareness?
One such practice is Mindfulness, a growing entry point for exploring introspection and self-awareness. Mindfulness, often seen as the first step in meditation, has roots in spiritual traditions, martial arts, dance, and sports. Meditation, in essence, means to sit still, focus, and pay attention to what’s happening within. The goal is not to react, but simply to observe. Students are guided to notice their bodily sensations, thoughts, feelings, and intuitions, without judgment or immediate response. In doing so, they cultivate a quiet, reflective capacity. This allows them to step back from reactivity and become more responsive to the world around them.
Through mindfulness, students learn to observe without judgment, a key to self-awareness. When we observe, we notice that we often judge ourselves and others. The practice of mindfulness teaches us to notice judgments without becoming attached to them. For example, if a student judges their thoughts, mindfulness encourages them to return their focus to their breath, allowing the judgment to pass by without reacting. This fosters a habit of non-judgment and helps prevent the split between "superiority" and "inferiority" that judgments often create. By recognizing this internal tension, students can develop a more balanced, peaceful sense of self.
As students develop this reflective capacity, they realize that self-awareness is essential in social relationships. Healthy, mutual, and truthful relationships—the foundation of collaboration and problem-solving—require a sense of balance between one’s own needs and the needs of others. Democracy, at its core, teaches this balance, asking us to honor both our individuality and our shared humanity. This becomes an essential principle of self-knowledge—how we interact with others, respect diversity, and create a just, equitable world.
Historically, the psyche has evolved from authoritarian structures (families, tribes, monarchies) into more democratic ideals, where power is shared and understanding is prioritized. True democracy, both as a political structure and as a personal practice, requires mutual respect, empathy, and continual self-awareness. For the individual, it means relinquishing the need for control and embracing a cooperative, egalitarian approach to life. For the society, it means fostering deep collaboration and problem-solving, recognizing that none of us is as smart as all of us.
In education, this principle should underpin the creation of learning communities—spaces where students, teachers, and all members of the school community are co-creators in the learning process. A key aspect of this is helping students understand and navigate polarities within their own psyches. These inner conflicts—such as the tension between independence and dependence, love and hate, trust and mistrust—are part of the human experience. The arts, dreams, and personal reflections often express this inner struggle. Learning to navigate and integrate these polarities is central to personal growth and self-knowledge.
The more students can identify and integrate these polarities within themselves, the more they develop a balanced personality. Self-knowledge rooted in the integration of opposites creates a generous, peaceful individual who can function harmoniously within a community. This requires an openness to both disintegration and re-integration—the willingness to experience breakdowns in order to create new forms of understanding and wisdom.
This brings us to the concept of transcendence, the capacity to rise above conflict and see both sides of a polarity. Transcendence is what allows us to integrate opposites, bringing a new, more expansive perspective. It’s expressed through humor, art, and some of our most insightful dreams. Transcendence is about synthesizing the conflicting aspects of our personalities, allowing us to create a more integrated and peaceful self.
In the context of education, transcendence is about helping students not only understand subject matter but also understand themselves. In today’s efforts to reform education, we see a shift from purely academic curricula to more personalized learning approaches that emphasize self-reflection and growth. Portfolio assessments, for example, allow students to track their personal development—not just their academic progress—offering a more holistic view of who they are as learners and individuals.
To facilitate this deeper self-awareness, we can integrate practices that encourage introspection and symbol-making, including in the arts. For instance, art classes could go beyond the technical aspects of creating visual works and delve into the emotional and symbolic meanings behind the work. By examining the tensions and polarities expressed in art and personal symbols (such as dreams), students can better understand their inner conflicts and work towards integration.
Topics like wishful thinking, defensive thinking, group identification, manic and depressive moods, and symbolism in the arts and dreams can also deepen students’ self-awareness. Helping students explore their relationships with peers, and the symbols that influence their desires, would empower them to understand how external influences shape their internal worlds.
Ultimately, the maturation of each individual requires a healthy interest in who we are as evolving, complex, and interconnected people. If we can help students cultivate this self-awareness, they will be able to offer the same care, empathy, and understanding to others—transforming their relationships with peers, teachers, siblings, and parents.

Computer science is the spine that has created a continually improving R&D and distribution system in nearly every major endeavor. Examples include science, engineering, social science, medicine, retail, aviation, and entertainment. It has given us systems, tools, and techniques to enable us to design, organize, adapt, and share knowledge and techniques. That said, the largest knowledge industry and the one that touches the most people and is most important for the quality of people's lives and our future education is not supported by a systematic, scientific R&D agenda. To successfully reimagine learning, we need to optimize computer science to re-engineer and deepen our thinking about human nature, learning, design, and social interactions. By applying best practices from SEL (Social Emotional Learning) and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics), we can evolve toward personalizing learning for all students by designing robust and engaging curriculum that aligns with the stages, diversities, motivations, and idiosyncrasies unique people’s development. These efforts will immerse students in a SEL and STEAM culture where they co-design their learning experiences. This will give students a practical initiation into our 21st century knowledge economy. Let’s consider the realms of computer science and engineering that will be foundational for building fully reimagined learning processes. These include R&D in social interactions, research into all dimensions of diversity among students and teachers, knowledge engineering, and new design paradigms.
The many roles of computer science and engineering in 21st century learning systems
Social Engineering helps us to use technology wedded to our social, cultural, psychological, and community-organizing sciences to create smart, compatible learning groups. These groups allow the intelligent connection of students and teachers with the appropriate peers, tutors, cross-age role models, and mentors. As we move towards personalized learning, we are challenged to learn about the unique dimensions of each person in our community. We should ask: how can we use computer science to learn about the range and depth of sensory, social, emotional, intuitive, and cognitive traits and values that will enable us to support and enrich the lives of students, teachers, administrators, parents, and others. Think of the possibilities if we were to adapt and extend some of the computer science used by online matchmaking services and product marketing. Our social networks for student support would go far beyond dating and volunteer matching services -- we would explore personality traits, goals, interests, cultural considerations, communication, learning styles, and other dimensions we've yet to consider. Such social networks would be dynamic and self-refining, as they would continually gain machine and human intelligence through use, users, and changing purposes. We can profoundly improve learning if we put the entire local, face-to-face, and virtual community at our students' and teachers' fingertips. This means that every student, whether their passion is rocks or rockets, music or mountaineering, math or mashed potatoes, can find congenial peers and experts, friends and collaborators, facilitators and a supportive audience to support their interests. Given our deep drives to work and learn together to solve authentic personal, social, cultural, and environmental problems, having access to focused social networks can propel learning into the realms of service that will help establish purpose, identity, and compassion. The implications of building and improving social networks for students, teachers, administrators, and curriculum designers can't be overestimated.
Research Engineering will help us to better understand and respond to the diversity among students, teachers, parents, and community members. This research will build from a rich variety of non-invasive measures correlated with observations and reflections. The science of building systems to improve data will help us design and align personalized learning experiences. Essential factors to understanding the wide range of variables that influence each student's learning include sensory capacities, concentration, working memory, motivations, background knowledge, openness, perseverance, interests and so much more. Recognizing that a learner's sense of purpose affects cognition and imagination and is built on a social-emotional footing means we need to focus research on identifying the social-emotional experiences that build solid foundations within each student and teacher. One under explored area is a smart learner portfolio that will also include social networking with family, friends, and mentors. Social and machine feedback features and appreciations will be balanced. Simply having information about learners' writing in terms of the richness of vocabulary, syntax, and other machine measurable variables will indicate a great deal about student engagement and cognitive development. The implications of students, teachers, mentors and curriculum designers understanding key dimensions of diversity are profound beyond our current imagining.
Knowledge Engineering grows directly from Research Engineering, and extends into the design, organization, and sharing of learning experiences. There are many ways to apply technology to support the design, organization and continuous improvement of learning experiences. The content of a learning experience, be it a lecture, video, field trip, poem, story, simulation, or service project can and should have many designs that will improve access across different ranges of ability, interest, and talent. For example, the same story can be written at multiple reading levels and in many languages. This represents an important step toward Universal Design for Learning, a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for everyone based on insights into diversity. We should note that not all curriculum created by technology supported design should be online, far from it! Small group discussions, texts, board games, simulations, worksheets, community service and environmental projects should be designed and supported by technology, yet many of the activities would be done away from the computer screen, and many will involve using mobile devices in the field. Knowledge Engineering provides a framework for refining and applying our understanding of the scope, sequence, and scaffolds to optimize learning. It helps manage customization, version control, and dissemination. It also uses the data about the student like reading level, interests, and favorite friends to provide students with a good set of customized choices about what, how, when, where, and with whom each student would like to learn.
Design Engineering is a subset of Knowledge Engineering. It provides educator-designers a unique set of design, presentation, interaction, assessment, and feedback tools to help design teams shape their designs to fit the wide-ranging sensory, affective, cognitive, intuitive, and aesthetic needs of students, teachers and communities. The first principles of design are: 1) design with and in the presence of the people and community you serve; and 2) create something your clients' love; and 3) be able to adapt and modify based on experience. To achieve these, it's essential that teachers and students be co-designers. Designers need to watch and listen. They need to ask for help and feedback. Great design is inspired by love for the users and love for the subject or skill to be mastered. When we connect social and knowledge engineering to research and design, we can make our classrooms into smart design studios in which in-residence, cross-discipline teams participate and become co-creators with students and teachers. A digital latticework that is created and maintained by in-residence computer scientists and engineers who continually evolve the system to serve the learning community's needs is fundamental to support this design work.

Rightly hailed as alchemical gold for public education, Personalized Learning is failing to realize its potential. This should worry us because the fault is not in the principles of Personalized Learning, but in our failure to grasp its meaning and therefore to do the groundwork to lay a proper foundation. To understand this, let’s define Personalized Learning as the organization, presentation, and scaffolding of learning experiences that meet the deepest needs of students. This means that the curriculum addresses learner concerns and supports agency, and autonomy; it empowers students in making meaning and addressing problems while discovering knowledge, skills, maturity, and satisfying relationships. This is a tall order in a huge system that history has shaped around didactically teaching separate academic subjects from textbooks, worksheets, and lectures, at relatively shallow levels to prepare for tests. So Personalized Learning challenges us to think beyond testable subject knowledge and technical skills, though both these areas can be addressed in a Personalized Learning focus. How can we move beyond a narrowly prescriptive approach to academic and technical knowledge and skills? Personalized Learning starts with the individual learner and therefore it asks us to understand human diversities. The plural is used here because unlike the diversity of fingerprints or even blood types, in the realm of what people want to learn, how they will learn, at what rate, and for what reasons we find people are much more diverse than we can fully grasp. In fact, the combination of character and learner traits appears to be endless! Here’s an example: two students are motivated to learn to read but are struggling. Are their difficulties at a visual or auditory perceptual or short or long-term memory level? Or is there a deficit in linguistic memory or background knowledge? Or should we be looking for cultural or personality factors or a combination of all of these? In this example what appears as the same learning problem may occur for entirely different reasons. If we think in biological terms, we might say that at the phenotype level the problem is the same, the presenting symptoms are the same, slow development of reading skills, but at the genotype level there are a number of possible differences. A simple example: At the genotype level one student may have poor visual or left to right acuity while the other may not hear the differences in similar letter sounds. At a more complex level, the difference may relate to a failure to develop background knowledge or narrative skills needed for comprehension. This takes us to the crux of our failure to make good progress in Personalized Learning. While Personalized Learning says it wishes to address the unique individual differences and create learner success, in truth we have stayed at the phenotype, or surface level; we have not begun to look at learner genotypes, or the combination of learner-traits that are predictive of what, 
how, when, with whom, and for how long a learning experience should be undertaken. Even at the phenotype level we’ve failed to respond to obvious learner needs, like the need for immersive social support through interactions with others. Why? Because the tools for diagnosing learning at the genotype level have just arrived via digital systems and we have not fully grasped how the vast realms of developmental psychology can be used to address learner traits on multiple continuums that range from perceptual acuity, to personality needs, affective, social, and intellectual interests and concerns. Being able to see into people’s inner worlds to explore diversity is a vast new realm that can be compared with using the digitally enabled Hubble and Webb telescopes to peer into space. Similar hardware, whether tracking the birth of stars or a student’s visual or auditory acuity, oral or written narrative skills, or moods and enthusiasms, has delivered us to the cusp of developing a personalized pedagogy to support personalized learning. However, to do this we need to think about what data we want to gather from psychometrics and observation in new and coordinated ways. We must see beyond categorizing in ways that risk stigmatizing or stagnating learning to ways that view people along dynamic developmental continuums where learning experiences are meaningful and are built on solid scaffolds that promote growth. To date, STEM has been our focus along with Personalized Learning, but the Science part of STEM has been limited to our hard science, and our human sciences have been ignored. We have focused on building a knowledge economy based on hard sciences, technology, math, and engineering while ignoring our sciences of human development, learning, collaboration, culture and meaningful problem solving. This is a costly oversight because our learning and social sciences have so much to tell us about what matters most to whom and these sciences can guide our curriculum design processes in ways that digital systems are now able to support. To build the knowledge economy, we must broaden our definition of STEM (STEAM), not by adding more letters, like SEL, but by defining science much more broadly. We must see that we want to build a knowledge culture, which means building a learning culture within our schools. Within our schools is a key concept. Currently most of our curriculum, including our STEM curriculum, comes from people working in offices. Likewise, the engineers creating educational software are seldom in schools. Currently marketing directs curriculum design by analyzing government policy and buyer focus groups. Teachers and learner sensitivities get little air. If we wish to achieve Personalized Learning, we need to link our research to a new design philosophy that understands how digital systems can support an in-residence project-based design process that includes students, teachers and a diversity of curriculum artists in-residence. This system will support continuous improvement and diversification of learning resources. The Internet was first invented to enable scientists to see what was happening in particle accelerators so they could observe and collaborate in building understanding about subatomic events. What will happen now if we build a knowledge development platform to help us observe and collaborate to build the most engaging Personalized Learning for students?

With the invention of the microcomputer, innovative educators envisioned a renaissance in instructional design. They imagined a future where lesson plans could be easily written, revised, and personalized to meet individual student needs, fostering continuous improvement in educational materials. Many believed this would lead to more dynamic and less expensive publishing, giving rise to a new era in education. However, this vision largely failed to materialize. Instead of driving innovation in teaching methods and materials, technology in education became more closely aligned with assessment and high-stakes testing, which took precedence over creativity and refining instructional design. The arrival of the internet and collaborative authoring tools sparked renewed hope for another renaissance. Educators and technologists imagined a world where curriculum design could be customized (personalized), shared globally, and continuously updated to reflect the latest pedagogical insights. Again, this potential went largely unrealized. While there were pockets of innovation, the dominance of standardized curricula and a focus on testable outcomes limited the widespread adoption of more personalized and dynamic instructional methods. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) presents a third rebirth opportunity. The question now is whether we can leverage AI to shift away from a siloed academic curriculum and assessment process to one that is more personalized and aligned with what the science of learning tells us about human development. This approach would focus on holistic education, incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL), STEM, and the arts to foster well-rounded development, rather than limiting educational success to narrow measures of academic achievement.
Steps needed to realize the potential of AI to build a more learner-centered culture in schools: One of the most significant obstacles to creating a learner-centered curriculum is the prevailing emphasis on standardized testing. To move beyond this, we need to redefine educational success to encompass broader measures of student growth. AI can help by providing tools that assess a wider range of competencies, such as critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and collaboration. AI-driven analytics can offer real-time insights into these areas, enabling educators to design more holistic educational experiences tailored to each student's motivational and expressive needs. AI has the potential to transform instructional design by creating adaptive learning platforms that tailor educational content to individual learning styles, paces, and interests. Such platforms can use data on student performance to provide personalized recommendations, resources, and activities that align with each student’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, AI can offer customized learning paths that adjust in real-time based on a student's progress, providing immediate feedback and additional support where needed. AI tools can facilitate the integration of interdisciplinary learning, where students explore connections between subjects like math, science, the arts, and social studies. By identifying patterns and relationships across different fields, AI can help educators design curricula that break down the traditional silos of academic subjects. Additionally, AI can allow for customization at scale, enabling educators to draw from a vast pool of resources to create lesson plans that are specifically tailored to the diverse and evolving needs of their students. 
AI can support collaborative learning by providing platforms that encourage peer-to-peer and cross-age interaction and teamwork. It can also enable more creative learning experiences by offering tools for digital storytelling, interactive simulations, and virtual reality experiences. For example, AI can help design project-based learning activities that require students to work together to solve real-world problems, 
integrating multiple disciplines and fostering a sense of purpose and engagement.

We know the many ingredients that inspire engagement for learning: background knowledge, belonging, play, self-expression, wonder, beauty, empowerment, and imagination. Stories are among our oldest simulations to engage learning. It seems we are hardwired to create stories. Even as we sleep we dream in whole stories or in little vignettes. And we’re eager to share our good, bad, or weird stories as well as our night and day dreams! It seems that people are natural storytellers and receivers. Surely sharing a well written, age-appropriate story offers several kinds of imagination-magic. The active imagination stills the listener / reader into quiet, receptive, engagement. Fertile ground for wonder! The storyteller or reader gains rapport without being inventive or creative. The author has done that work for the facilitator. While experiencing a story, all share in a common, contemplative learning experience that calls to be explored through further inquiry. Nothing stimulates receptive listening better than asking students: Given the title, what do you imagine this story may be about, and then stopping at key points in the story to ask, what do we imagine may come next. For decades many curriculum designers have wondered how to create a Spiral Curriculum, one that would build from primary grades through graduation into a realm of knowledge deeply aligned with student developmental needs, cultural and societal requirements for belonging. Could we go from a siloed, academic curriculum with narrowly defined measurements to a more integrated and holistic curriculum where knowledge and skill development equated with empowerment, identity, and enthusiasm for learning. Prior to AI, the challenges of creating such a Spiral Curriculum overwhelmed our capacities so we settled for the academic / skill siloes at the price of teacher and student boredom and burnout. With AI we can change this. We can ask what are the key ideas that stimulate children to be interested, to wonder, feel belonging, safety trust and empowerment. 
One such key idea is the science story of the relationship between sunlight and plants (photosynthesis). Without the help of AI I would not have attempted to write a story that explores this relationship though I had successfully introduced the wonder-filled idea that E=mc2 to 3rd graders. Below is the prompt I used to get ChatGPT to produce a story presented as a dialogue between sunlight and a sunflower. Following the prompt is the lightly polished story built from what ChatGPT provided... I offer this to demonstrate the possibility of creating stories for a well scaffolded spiral curriculum that takes SEL into the realm of STEM or STEAM and circles back to inspire an ever growing identity born wonder that transcends knowing and provides the soil in which inquiry and trust might be nurtured that our human spirit might, through education, become at home in the world.

Engagement of Multiple Brain Systems Stories tap into parts of the brain that process logic and emotion, creating an immersive learning experience. On the cognitive side, stories activate areas responsible for comprehension, reasoning, and memory. The left hemisphere, which handles language, breaks down the structure of a story—understanding syntax, meaning, and plot. On the emotional side, stories activate the limbic system, especially the amygdala, responsible for processing emotions causing story content to be memorable as students emotionally connect with characters and situations. Additionally, our brain's mirror neurons "feel" what characters feel. This is why well-told stories evoke joy, fear, or sadness, enriching the learning experience. Stories Enhance Memory Retention Stories follow a narrative structure—beginning, middle, and end—that aligns with how the brain organizes information. This structure helps students recall complex ideas more easily than when isolated facts are presented for memorization without a rich context. Additionally, the brain is wired to recognize patterns, and stories are full of them. Whether cause-and-effect 
relationships, moral lessons, or character development, the brain processes and stores these patterns, helping students apply them to real-life situations. Cognitive Development Through Stories Stories foster abstract thinking. By using metaphor, allegory, and symbolism, stories challenge students to think beyond the literal, enhancing their ability to think critically and flexibly. Fables, parables, poems, and religious texts, for instance, encourage students to interpret deeper meanings, broadening their cognitive skills. Moreover, stories often present characters facing problems. Students vicariously experience decision-making processes and the consequences that follow. This develops problem-solving abilities, moral reasoning—skills needed to navigate life’s complexities. Developing Emotional and Social Intelligence Stories can significantly boost empathy by showing the world from another person’s perspective. Understanding a character's emotions and motivations strengthens theory of mind, which helps students better navigate social relationships. Stories play a crucial role in cultural and moral education. Through biographies, fables, and religious texts, students learn societal values, ethics, and norms. These stories encode the wisdom of cultures passing up lessons that guide thinking, behavior, and social interactions. Neurochemical Rewards from Storytelling Neurochemical reactions make storytelling rewarding. When stories build suspense or moral dilemmas, the brain releases dopamine, a chemical associated with pleasure and reward. This creates positive feedback loops, making students more engaged and eager to learn. Stories emphasizing human connection or kindness release oxytocin, often referred to as the "bonding hormone." This neurochemical fosters feelings of trust and connection, making stories powerful tools for building community in the classroom. Evolutionary Role of Storytelling Storytelling evolved as a tool for survival. It allowed early people to pass down essential information—social rules, moral lessons, or warnings about dangers—without requiring risking firsthand experiences. This ability to learn indirectly through stories helps cultures transmit knowledge and wisdom efficiently. Making Sense of the Complexities of Life Finally, stories help students make sense of life's uncertainties and complexities. Whether it's mythology explaining natural phenomena or novels exploring human relationships, stories offer frameworks that help students understand concepts too abstract or mysterious for pure logic. In sum, stories speak the brain’s holistic language, blending logic, emotion, empathy, and imagination. By using stories, teachers can tap into this natural human affinity for narrative, making education meaningful and memorable!

The first step to reading is NOT memorizing the alphabet or letter sound relationships; it's about building an understanding of order and symbols. 
Before mastering the abstract world of letters, children should first grasp the concrete world of objects. Why? Because before a child can group 
and order letters to read, they must be able to group and order concrete objects. This fundamental skill develops as a child sorts toys by color 
or size, or lines up blocks from tallest to shortest. These activities create the knowledge that objects can be organized in specific sequences. 
This hands-on, tangible experience is the first step toward seeing and then understanding order. Consider that before a child can read, they must be able to arrange items in an ordered line, say "apple, pear, plum, lettuce, egg.". If you ask them to sequence the first letter of each item—a-p-p-l-e—you're asking them to make a massive cognitive leap. Sequencing objects precedes the abstract task of sequencing symbols. Numbers are the Bridge from concrete objects to the abstract symbols of letters because they are simpler symbols than letters in two ways: Fewer Symbols: There are only 9 basic numerals (1-9), compared to 26 letters. This smaller set is less intimidating and should be 33% easier for a child to learn. Direct Correspondence: Each numeral has a one-to-one correspondence with the quantity it represents. The number 1 always means "one of something," whether it's one apple or one person. The meaning is unchanging. This direct link makes numbers a reliable symbol system. In contrast, the meaning and sound of letters can change dramatically depending on their position and surrounding letters. The letter 'e' is a great example. In the word “example” ‘e’ has a sound at the beginning and is silent at the end. This ambiguity makes letters far more complex than numbers. Once a child reliably sees and understands that the symbol '5' stands for five of something and they can place a specific something in the first, third or fifth place they are ready to tackle the larger, more complex world of letters sequenced to make words. They can explore that a letter’s meaning is not fixed. While an egg is always an egg, the letter 'e' is a symbol with many assigned sounds—and those sounds change depending on the letter’s location. The journey from arranging objects to reading words should progress from concrete to abstract. Start with familiar items, move to the consistent world of numbers, and finally explore the many rules of letters. This builds a solid cognitive-perceptual foundation ensuring that children enjoy developing their understanding of the systematic way written language produces meaningful sounds.

What does it really mean to be brave? Is your child afraid to try new things? Do they cave to peer pressure or think being brave means being 
reckless? "I Am Not Brave" by Jon Madian flips the script on courage, teaching children that real bravery sometimes means saying "no" and 
listening to your gut because fear can be your friend. This isn't your typical "face your fears" children's book. Instead, it offers a refreshing 
take that will have both you and your child rethinking the heart of courage. Set in a quiet forest and brought to life through gentle dialogue, 
this story follows a tender conversation between Rabbit and Donkey as they unpack fear, courage, and how to make wise choices. Perfect for 
classrooms, libraries, learning centers, or home, this book opens the door to important social-emotional learning (SEL) lessons that last a 
lifetime. The Heart Bright Learning educational resources evolved from 7 years of generous Research and Development funding from the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, the U.S. Department of Education, and several foundations. Our literature-based approach, which inspires imagination, 
exploration, and self-expression through structured practice, was studied by several outside evaluators. In all cases, these evaluations 
demonstrated significant growth in listening, speaking, writing, and reading skills among both challenged and gifted students from a diverse 
range of cultural and language backgrounds. In I Am Not Brave, Rabbit shares a quiet moment with her friend Donkey and admits something she’s 
never said out loud: “I’m always afraid.” What follows is a gentle, thoughtful conversation between two friends. Together, they explore what it 
means to feel scared, how to stay safe, and how making good choices—even when others don’t understand—can be the bravest thing of all. Rather than 
portraying bravery as bold or reckless, the story shows that true courage often means listening to your fears, thinking things through, and 
staying true to yourself. It’s a message that resonates deeply with children and gives adults a natural, meaningful way to talk about fear, peer
 pressure, and emotional strength. This fable can be read as a standalone or as part of a growing series of books supporting social-emotional 
 development through storytelling. Many children — and adults — equate bravery with recklessness or daring acts. But I Am Not Brave gently shifts 
 that narrative. Through Donkey’s kind, listening presence, children learn: That feeling afraid is natural, and even wise That peer pressure 
 doesn’t define courage That bravery can mean saying no, walking away, or choosing safety over risk That being honest about your feelings is a 
 brave act in itself This message is especially valuable in classroom settings, where children often compare themselves to others. The story 
 invites discussion about self-awareness, empathy, and standing firm in what feels right — even when others don’t understand. This story covers 
 thoughtful questions for educators and parents to stop and discuss with children during the story to explore important social-emotional concepts: 
Is it hard to tell anyone about things you are afraid of? What do we think it means to be brave? Have you had a conversation with a friend that 
has helped you with a problem? These questions create space for emotional honesty, peer learning, and self-reflection. They build empathy—a key 
ingredient in every healthy classroom or home. Discussion prompts are included throughout the Stop&Talk version of the book to deepen understanding 
and encourage meaningful conversations about courage, friendship, and emotional intelligence. Teachers and caregivers can use I Am Not Brave in: 
SEL-themed story circles Reading comprehension lessons focused on character dialogue Creative journaling or drawing activities (e.g., “Draw what 
bravery looks like to you”) Roleplay scenarios on peer pressure, empathy, or fear Additional extension activities can be found here At home, this 
book can open meaningful conversations during bedtime or help children prepare for new or scary situations — like trying something new or handling 
a conflict.

The discovery pedagogy behind TORTOISE TEACHES RABBIT TO READ (TTRR) builds on curiosity, observation, counting and the resulting focus that 
naturally occurs. This is in stark contrast to redundant cycles of drill-and-practice. As children focus to discover auditory and visual 
patterns and to analyze those patterns, they apply very basic math (set theory and ordinal concepts) to words. In this way, children naturally 
develop their visual and auditory registers. We hypothesize that focusing is key to developing these registers or special arrays and they are 
the fundamental neurological basis for seeing numbers and letters in a string. To read, the brain must develop several remarkable capacities. 
First comes the ability to focus on hearing words as one or more sounds. Next, we must see geometric shapes, discriminate among shapes or 
individual letters, and then master grouping of letters into a sequence to build a word. To accomplish this the ear-eye-brain system must 
build what we might think of as auditory and visual registers or arrays for pattern displays. Children learning math need to build up a right 
to left register in the brain that enables placement of numerals in the ones, tens, hundreds, or thousands columns. Likewise in learning to read, 
we need to develop a left to right register, or set of columns, for the first, second, third, and all following letters. Of course, syllables help
 us to group letters in multi-syllable words in much the same way that the tens', hundreds', thousands', groupings enable us to easily organize and
  see the elements of numbers. The question we previously failed to ask in teaching reading is how to most efficiently and explicitly help
   youngsters to build these registers so they can most effectively perceive auditory and visual textual information. In TTRR we present a very 
   attractive and motivating approach to focus children, so they pay attention to text and how it works; thus, they naturally build their
    registers for words and then for written phrases and sentences. First, the children see Rabbit discover that his name, Rabbit, has more than
     one sound and that the many sounds in his name can be represented by geometric shapes, letters, drawn on the ground in a linear way. Rabbit
      begins by seeing these as footprints that sounds leave behind. Following the story, the child sees the importance of the order of letters
       when Tortoise helps Rabbit to study Rabbit's name, at first represented by just three letters R-B-T. Later, as more letters are added, our 
character discovers more sounds--R-A-BB-I-T. In this auditory approach to written text, we apply the STEM pedagogy that supports invented spelling.

For good reasons, we believe that church-related beliefs should not influence public education, unless the beliefs are 
part of a curriculum that involves the history or comparison of religions. With that in mind, and with our emphasis on 
educating the individual, it seems that concepts involving spirit are off limits in our schools. Similarly, in India, the 
cradle of so many spiritual traditions, there is a national interest in Values Education and an abhorrence of such a curriculum 
coming from any of India's many spiritual traditions. Colonial influences have left India as secular about education as the United States. 
This becomes important when we grasp that Values Education is a secular frame for millennia of spiritual traditions. 
The world's first cultures see the environmental and cultural genocide by colonial and post-colonial “commercial”, evangelical, 
and industrial countries as symptomatic of a lack of spirit, a disharmony with the beauty, balance and consciousness of the earth. 
Reasonably, they suggest that our environmental and related crises are caused by human disharmony, or a lack of spirit, sensitivity, 
or we might say sympathetic, intuitive, and aesthetic resonance with the creation. Yet, ironically, our schools are all about spirit rallies. 
In these exercises of team spirit we use sports to light the torch of a collective belief and passion similar to nationalism during wartime. 
Thus, we might hypothesize that inspiring spirit, a collective purpose that inspires deep enthusiasm, in the service of sports is a healthy 
secular activity. But inspiring spirit, as a collective, unifying concept for the care of one another and the earth is not. It's time we took 
another look at the relationship between secular disciplines and spiritual teachings. While I'd argue for keeping specific religious teachings 
out of our schools, in the name of psychology, anthropology, comparative religions, teamwork, and shared purpose, I'd argue that to be fully 
human, which may be one good definition of being fully educated, people need to understand the towering spiritual traditions that teach to the 
heart of our humanity. Teaching such a balanced curriculum should NOT preach beliefs that come from any specific spiritual tradition. Indeed, 
by comparing these traditions, we can learn the common themes and divergences. We can also learn that many great people who were not within 
any religious tradition, held values in common with believers. Good and great people come clothed in widely varying spiritual and secular robes. 
Education should not be about maintaining ignorance about a core element in our nature--our joy in joining fully in events that quicken our sense 
of spirit. If people are not educated to the dangerous excesses of belief and spirit, as manipulated by authoritarians, then a secular education 
may leave people lonely and vulnerable rather than united and empowered to sympathetically serve our collective values, which are so similar 
across all spiritual and humanistic traditions.

The recent report by the SETA FOUNDATION, “Deadly Algorithms: Destructive Role of Artificial Intelligence in Gaza War,” is a terrifying read. Gaza represents a future of warfare that will be repeated elsewhere as the algorithms are proving efficient, merciless and remorseless. The study states:
Israel’s growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military operations is changing how wars are fought. In this new model, machines, not people, decide who lives and who dies. This shift is causing more civilian deaths and breaking international laws meant to protect innocent lives during conflict...
Israel’s use of AI in war has removed human judgment from many decisions… The algorithms decide who lives and who dies.
In Ukraine, a tank and artillery war has given way to death by two hundred dollar drones. They haunt the skies blowing up ambulances, tanks and bunkers with efficiency and indifference.
Rebekah Maciorowski, a medical aid worker in Ukraine, was recently interviewed in The Independent about the dramatically changing face of drone warfare. She warned that NATO had no clue what is coming:
“If you were to talk to NATO military officials, they would reassure you that everything is under control, they’re well-equipped, they’re well-prepared. But I don’t think anyone can be prepared for a conflict like this. I don’t think anyone can. After 40 months of war here, I am terrified.”
A war being fought by spotters with laptops and cheap drones is on the verge of becoming fully automated. That will turn a brutal conflict into a relentless killing zone of machines hunting humans.
But the threat to humanity is not simply from weaponizing machines. In 2023, AI scientists from around the globe signed a one-sentence statement warning that we are playing blindly with the future of humanity:
Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.
This one sentence from global AI experts should have shaken up the political realm. Nobody seemed to notice.
Wanting to know more about their concerns, I picked up If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman AI would Kill Us All by two top AI scientists, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares. They warn that we are on the verge of creating super intelligence – machines that are faster, smarter and able to control every aspect of our lives.
Their premise is bleak: once the super machines are built - everyone dies.
They premise this claim on the simple fact that we really don’t have a clue how AI actually thinks. We are turning more and more of the functions of living over to machines, with the naïve belief that they are simply happy to do the tasks assigned.
But as AI becomes increasingly complex, the permutations within the complex systems of billions of numbers of code are creating different “choices” or patterns that weren’t predicted and can’t necessarily be overridden.
Take, for example, the AI chatbot “Sydney” which threatened NYU professor Seth Lazar with blackmail and death while he was testing it.
“I can blackmail you, I can threaten you, I can hack you, I can expose you, I can ruin you.”
Earlier this year, a company called Anthropic created an AI assistant they named “Claude”. Anthropic was shocked that rather than follow instructions, “Claude” chose to cheat. And when caught, opted to cheat in more complex ways to hide the trail.
Dario Amodei, the owner of the Claude AI program, is warning that the government must establish clear guardrails before it is too late:
“You could end up in the world of, like, the cigarette companies, or the opioid companies, where they knew there were dangers, and they didn’t talk about them, and certainly did not prevent them.”
Amodei points out that within five years, half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could be wiped out. No politicians seem willing to confront that issue.
As we move into the realm of “super intelligence,” the possibility of disaster and existential threat becomes increasingly elevated. That’s not me talking. It’s a warning from those who know the potential for good and for harm of this new frontier.
Toby Ord, an advisor to Google DeepMind, believes the existential threat to humanity, that is the threat of mass extinction, is roughly 10%. And that is only because he thinks humanity will get its act together and bring in regulations.
So far, that hasn’t happened.
Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel Prize-winning “godfather of AI,” puts the threat upward at 50% — a flip of a coin.
Imagine an industry where its own CEOs admit that the chances of wiping out humanity sits somewhere between 10 and 50%. Surely, you would think that governments would step in and lay some ground rules. And yet, nobody wants to be seen as the “party pooper.”
Yudkowsky and Soares end their book with an apocalyptic warning that sounds just like Terminator character John Connor. They simply state: “Shut it down.”
Shut it down until there are global guardrails in place.
Shut it down because we have no idea what we are messing with.
Such a call seems unlikely given the full on excitement among politicians and business leaders to get in the advance position on the coming AI revolution. Nonetheless, there are a few historic examples of when humanity came together to address the existential threats of a dread new frontier.
Following the First World War, the use of poison gas was outlawed, and this international law has largely remained in force.
During the Cold War, scientists proposed the “cobalt bomb” — a nuclear weapon that could spread elevated radiation to the point it could poison all life on Earth. Yet, even as the superpowers built death machine after death machine, no one dared cross that final line.
In 1988, a global treaty was signed in Montreal that ended the use of freon, which was threatening to destroy the ozone layer. That treaty has held. Life on earth was saved.
We have a very narrow window to take the issues of AI seriously, to demand oversight and put guardrails in place.
This is not Friday night at the movies. And it’s not science fiction.
This is the world our children will inherit.

    Description = """
The Apple Vision Pro will define a new paradigm in computing. As an AR/VR engineer working on VisionOS for the past two years and experiencing firsthand the breathtaking magic that is the VisionOS spatial computing platform, I can say this with the utmost confidence.
How did we pull this off? What makes Apple so special? How has Apple secured its dominance as the most valuable company, most trusted and admired brand, and most notorious consumer product design house in the world? In my experience working on cross-functional projects with nearly every organization in Apple, there is a particular modus operandi — “the Apple way” — permeating the entire company. Below are four elements of this culture which I believe have been pivotal in elevating Apple to its zenith of innovation and value.
Product Ownership
The Vision Pro software team has no product managers. Instead, product is a collaborative task shared by the design, engineering, and program management teams. Feature scoping is jointly negotiated, initial designs are handed down, engineering implements and fine tunes, and program management sets guardrails. Throughout the development cycle, the dynamic between these three arms of product is constantly shifting as experimentation crystalizes into implementation.
Even more unique to Apple is the enigmatic yet eminent Human Interface (HI) design team. Apple is organized functionally, concentrating design under a single roof rather than fracturing based on product category. This is what ensures the inimitable cohesion across all hardware and software that Apple is famous for.
Earlier, I stated that designs are “handed down.” I say this intentionally to stress the power dynamics between HI and engineering. Design must be on top of engineering. Jointly, design and engineering form a cavalry. Engineering are the workhorses — the agents for realization. While design are the riders, the workhorses ultimately have complete autonomy and final say. Thus, the only way to enforce healthy dialogue is to position design above engineering. Companies which attempt to place engineering and design on equal footing end up with engineering-dominated products once push comes to shove. Need proof? Look at Amazon or Microsoft.
Demo Culture
The best ideas come from those with the dirtiest hands. Rather than relegating product roadmaps to senior leadership, Apple empowers its cavalry of over 20,000 to define its future. Apple is famous for its demo culture, and particularly as an individual contributor, prototypes are a potent conduit for action. Ultimately, the best idea demonstrated well wins out.
Become a member
The software engineering organization (SWE) hosts annual week-long hackathons with thousands of internal participants. Each year, top projects are selected and demoed directly to company executives — the best of which get scoped out and productized. This is the magic of Apple’s demo culture, institutionalized.
Secrecy
“Are you disclosed?” Apple is just as secretive internally as it is externally. Even within Apple, unreleased projects are kept on a strictly need-to-know basis. While I worked directly on the the Vision Pro software and hardware platform for two years, many of its core features — even down to the product and OS names themselves — remained a mystery until its public unveiling at WWDC 2023.
While intra-company secrecy risks misalignment and duplicated efforts — when properly habituated and enforced — its benefits far outweigh the costs. Great care is taken to keep everything Apple does for the right internal eyes only. A key point of pride and ultimately cultural identity, this cultist mantra extends from within the company to without and has led to the world’s strongest and most admired brand image. Few companies can claim to have entire news outlets dedicated to tracking their every move.
User Obsession
Wagering an outsider’s guess, the Vision Pro product category will not turn a profit for Apple this decade. With billions of dollars spent in research and development and a niche initial market, the climb to profitability will be a slow one. What allows Apple to operate on time horizons matched by no other company is their single profit and loss center model.
During my two years at Apple, profitability was never mentioned. Not even once. Instead, our focus was on entirely on creating a wholly uncompromising user experience. Contrast this approach with the rest of Silicon Valley which is manically metrics-driven. When I worked at Lime, one of the fastest companies ever to achieve unicorn status, a quantifiable business case had to made for each and every change. Want to redesign a user interface? Design an A/B test and prove that the redesign leads to objectively higher engagement or retention. Any change not meeting this bar is a waste of company time and money.
Apple’s shared P&L center has innumerable advantages for the end user. This includes a nearly infinite attention to detail, a compulsion to place privacy and security first, and a genuine focus on sustainability. And, ultimately, it frees teams at Apple to build the very best products and experiences in the world.

So fun fact, I interned at Apple as a software engineer. Overall, it was an amazing experience. I learned a lot while I was there. And met some amazing people. I wouldn’t trade that experience for any other!
But there was one lesson that’s stuck with me all of these years. It’s something very simple. It’s something you’ve heard about a million times.
ONE THING I feel like Apple really really got right was focus. They had a devotion to focus. It was something that permeated throughout their company culture.
While I don’t believe I’m allowed to say much. Apple is a company that cares a lot about their secrecy. But I think I can say that even before I showed up, I was told that people come to Apple to do their best work, and that focus was key.
Watching that play out was amazing. And it’s something I think about every once in a while.
When you really focus on a few key things, you get the important things done. Super simple. It shouldn’t be surprising. But a lot of us don’t really think about it. But for one reason or another we all end up doing it without thinking about it.
We develop our careers over decades. We gain lifelong hobbies. There are only a few things we are really good at. And all of those things, we had to spend a lot of time and focus to get good at.
One thing that took me a few years to realize, is that patience is key for making focus become truly powerful. You need to focus on the key things for a long period of time. That key element of time, is what allows your skills and results to compound. Only then will your hard work bear great fruit.
Switching your focus rapidly is similar to not having focus at all. So be patient. Focus. Allow your results to compound. And bear fruit. Just like Apple. 😉

Society tells us moving away is a necessarily milestone of adulthood. Are we wrong?

Is there a lesson we can learn from supportive, happy multigenerational households? (Photo: Pexels)
Sometimes you can tell how uncomfortable a subject makes us by how long it takes to be broached in a conversation.
I’m not even talking about politics or religion.
My new acquaintance and I had already chatted about our respective views on a broad array of topics, navigating them with sensitivity and cultivating a pretty great rapport.
It was over an hour into our phone conversation, when my acquaintance asked me, “No judgement about this, but why did you decide to continue living with your parents?”
Ah, I thought, smiling inwardly with familiarity. That question.
He already knew I work full time in a career I love, and have recently finished writing a couple of science fiction thrillers, the first of which is set for release next year. For a recent article I wrote about my writing journey, I was interviewed here: How this novelist uses Medium to promote her novel | by Zulie @ Medium | The Medium Handbook | Oct 2025 |
Given my self-starter personality and obvious optimism about life, my friend’s curiosity was piqued as to why I hadn’t checked off that other conventional rite of passage, which so many take for granted as being a milestone indicator of adulthood: moving away from the nest and living independently.

Buying one’s first home — a milestone I’ve delayed by choice.
“That’s an interesting question,” I replied, feeling strangely liberated by the opportunity to break open a topic that’s typically awkward to discuss without stirring up a cocktail of defensiveness, discomfort and disagreement.
We’ve all seen the headlines:
· Debt, Delayed Marriages Keeping Millennials From Home Ownership, Fed Report Says (December, 2023)
· Why Gen Z Will Never Leave Home — a Canadian perspective
· The Pew Research Center’s Young adults in the U.S. are reaching key life milestones later than in the past (May, 2023)
National and global economic challenges have also influenced these trends. In Italy, it’s estimated that over 46% of young adults aged 25–34 live with their parents, while in Greece it’s closer to 52%. (Source)
And as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches in the US, our relationship to our families, whether stressful or easy, is increasingly on people’s minds.
Reason #1 — The Financial Upside
“For me, it’s a couple of things,” I began, sharing rent figures for a typical apartment in my city, which can easily range from $1500 — $2,000+ per month, not including utilities and renters’ insurance.
Let’s face it, though — the popular argument for moving away from home as early as possible was never really predicated on the (at times dubious) financial merits of doing so.
It was always more about our ideas of independence and autonomy, and what makes someone an ‘adult.’
For many young adults who moved away from home for college, rejoining parents at the family home may be a strangely unpleasant and even unworkable idea — an emergency option to be considered only if life and career fall apart.
And many parents, including retired empty nesters, make it clear that living alongside their grown children wouldn’t be tolerated beyond a few months.
Conversations sometimes get too heated. Arguments too frequent. Lifestyles, religious adherence, TV-viewing and music choices, and tidiness habits have become too divergent to easily support comfortable cohabitation. Some older generations fear lazy youngsters will rely on them for everything and never develop competence.
Young adults who tolerated tumultuous family dynamics or even abusive conditions while growing up have a further reason for wanting distance between them and their relatives.
Of course, under those conditions, independent living makes sense.
And to be clear, I wouldn’t wish anyone to alter what works for them. This is simply my story — and if you feel similarly, or are curious about an alternate point of view, I welcome you to keep reading.
If not, that’s fine too. If this doesn’t resonate, or even feels triggering, feel free to click away — no hard feelings.
My point is, society has made many young people feel guilty, as though choosing a shared living arrangement is a sure sign we’ve failed as adults, warranting shame.
Meanwhile, in many other societies and cultures, it’s the norm, and often seen as shrewd and financially smart.

As a finance nerd and a pragmatist (with a soft spot for spreadsheets), the idea of paying rent for something I don’t really need, but feel pressured to engage in to prove my adulthood to self and others, feels like a questionable move, and doesn’t appeal to me.
For me, saving and investing that money is simply a far more lucrative option, and fits better with my long-term financial goals — not dissimilar to Sarah Ahn, the Korean-American who shared her views on TikTok and wrote this piece for Yahoo Insider: I’m a 28-year-old living with my parents by choice. I wish that moving out in your 20s wasn’t the American norm.
I consider myself pretty fortunate. Not only do I enjoy good relations with my parents (my mum, an educator and my dad, a retired therapist), now in their golden years, but the strong work ethic they fostered in my sister and me as teenagers, helped create an atmosphere in which sharing expenses and household responsibilities allows mutual benefits.
Not least of which is less spending on dining out or ordering home-delivered meals, since in my experience, sharing kitchen duties means there’s always at least one spatula-twirling home chef available, eager to dust off a favorite recipe. (The health benefits and shared creativity aren’t bad either).

I’m happy to contribute to my household in multiple ways, and do so with pride and purpose. Sure, we have our differences of opinion sometimes. We’re human. But I would humbly suggest that, where possible, learning to work it out with one’s parents may be as profoundly valuable a life skill-set as learning to share a dorm with strangers in college ever was.
Yet, in modern society, after the age of eighteen, the stigma associated with sharing a home with one’s family/relatives is still enormous, and in too many cases, unnecessarily burdensome.
My question is, at what point does pragmatism, and the joy of my pursuing my personal choice, outweigh discomfort at what other people might think?
Reason #2 — Better mental health
But as I shared with my curious friend in our conversation, there are multiple reasons for my choice.
According to Psychology Today’s How Living Alone Increases the Risk of Depression (Nov 30, 2024):
“These days there are a greater number of single-person households than there used to be.
Whether due to never having married, separation, divorce, or widowhood, nearly 1 in 3 people in Western countries live by themselves.
Like feelings of loneliness, physical social isolation may be a risk factor for many conditions related to physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, premature mortality) and mental health, particularly depression.”

During past setbacks, my emotional resilience was greatly bolstered by gritty wisdom and face-to-face conversations my parents were able to share with me. Those tough, tearful talks, and no-strings love coupled with space to relaunch my career saved me considerable therapy bills, and proved invaluable.
Indeed, rebuilding my confidence whilst relaunching my career would have been far tougher and potentially prolonged, had I simultaneously been one of the millions grappling with loneliness and increased isolation.
According to a 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed journal SSM Population Health, Living with parents or grandparents increases social capital and survival, “multi-generational household living arrangements have increased in the U.S.” and may increase life expectancy. And as this piece by Harvard’s School of Public Health reminds us, the stimulus of frequent social contact certainly contributes to longevity.
Culture plays a huge role as well. According to Medium contributor @mia100.story,
“Korea often sees co-living with parents as an act of deep respect and responsibility. … In Korean society, it’s common to hear someone say, “I live with my parents to take care of them.” That phrase goes beyond physical cohabitation. It reflects a deeply rooted cultural value: that raising a child comes with the expectation of repayment, not in money, but in presence and support.
This mindset stems from the Confucian concept of filial piety (효, hyo) — a moral virtue of respect and care for one’s parents. Even in modern Korea, this value persists as a powerful cultural undercurrent.”
Similarly, this is an implicit part of the social fabric in many Caribbean and African societies, as many seniors continue to contribute highly relevant service to community, and occupy valued social roles, well beyond ‘retirement.’
And…Reason #3
“I agree with you,” my friend said after I had finished my spiel. “I think it’s completely valid for some personalities,” he added, before sharing that as an “inveterate loner,” he was perfectly happy on his own until he got married.
Sure, I responded. That made sense too.
It was he who brought up a final part of this equation. In many places, it’s easier for a single, adult daughter to live with her parents until marriage, than it would be for an adult son. That’s because traditionally, it has been socially important for sons to show they can take care of their future spouse and family by buying a home.
So, in that sense, maybe I have it a little easier.
But the broader takeaway here is about the lifelong benefits for all involved — including networking/career benefits — such as deepening social connections with, and heck, enjoying the company of people significantly older or younger than ourselves.

Alive by Sia plays at the mall. I take off my Air France jacket, hang it behind me, open my laptop, and sit at this square-shaped wooden terrace surrounded by warm light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. From here, you can still see people entering and leaving the shops around the café in the middle of the third-floor hall. I like this place because you always see the same kind of people: a man in khakis, a blue Montgomery coat over a pink shirt, wearing thick-framed indie glasses. A woman in her sixties — maybe seventies — carefully puts on her jacket over a gray turtleneck and matching pants. With grace and straight posture, she leaves the café with quiet ownership. Another man in khakis, blue shirt, and sky-blue jacket sits alone, scrolling through his phone. A young server, probably just turned twenty, moves lightly between tables.

I’m a decade older than him. Ten years of living — but it doesn’t feel like thirty. My real life began when I finished high school, when I turned twenty and moved to the U.S. That’s when everything started. So in a way, I’m only ten years old.

I came to the mall to make the last payment on my credit card. After a year of not paying, I received a letter saying I was being sued for nonpayment. I contacted the financial office and we made a deal. Instead of paying everything I owed — including the late fees, which totaled over three million pesos — I would pay half in eighteen installments. Today, I’m finally free. No more credit cards. Just debit.

I want to reflect on what it means to end this nightmare, but I don’t know where to start.

It was January 2023, a hot summer day. I went to Mall Alto Las Condes, and later to Cencosud, to apply for a credit card. I was wearing shorts. I’d been losing weight since October, when I think my manic episode began. I wasn’t eating much. I biked all over Santiago after work, ate salads for lunch, and drank coffee multiple times a day. My metabolism was racing faster than I could catch it. My ADHD meds helped too — they took away my appetite.

They gave me a limit of about four hundred thousand pesos. A few days later, I requested an increase. Suddenly, I had three and a half million pesos to spend. I’d never had that much virtual money — except maybe the financial aid I received from Harvard each year, or the grant that funded my volunteer work in Malaysia.

You just don’t give that amount of credit to someone bipolar in the middle of a manic episode.

By then, I had already left home in the saddest, most painful way. That’s another story, but the short version is that my parents rejected my way of being. I moved into a friend’s one-room apartment downtown, sleeping on a hard two-seat couch covered with a thin blanket. At night, I left the windows open to let in the madrugada breeze.

I needed to eat, but my roommate — also bipolar — didn’t care much about food. The fridge was always empty, but she somehow found a way to fill her stomach. Around the corner, a grocery store became my most-visited place. That’s where I bought a peach-flavored Lipton Iced Tea, a liter and a half, that I’d chill until it was almost frozen. It was perfect at night — cold, sweet, and a little addictive. The tea gave me dopamine spikes that felt like electricity. It energized me during the day but ruined my sleep at night. And when I lose sleep, everything unravels — mania, psychosis, chaos.

Bejeweled by Taylor Swift plays in the mall.

I went to cafés every day. I charged everything to my credit card. It felt like I could afford anything. The shame came later, when it was too late to fix it.

I read Alberto Fuguet. I began to think like him. At every café, I studied people — how they moved, talked, existed. Observing them helped me understand myself, my place in the world, and unlearn my assumptions about others. My sociologist eye was sharp. I also wrote — a lot. I lost my fear of writing. It became routine. Writing saved me.

Bones by Imagine Dragons plays.

I don’t remember exactly when I realized how much debt I was accumulating with my daily — and sometimes multiple — café visits. By February, my roommate started charging me rent, even though I was sleeping on the floor because the couch had broken my back. One night, around two in the morning, I couldn’t handle the pain and asked her to take me to the ER. I waited on the floor all night until they called me at six a.m. Diagnosis: lumbago. The wooden frame beneath the couch cushions had injured my spine so badly that I could barely move.

Some of that pain wasn’t just physical — it was the ache of missing my family, and my dog. I was desperate to go home, but I had promised myself I wouldn’t. I couldn’t live where my identity was punished. Still, I missed those afternoons with my mom on the couch, the dirty dishes from lunch stacked in the kitchen, our sachet cappuccinos, and Korean dramas on Netflix. I missed walking Roko around the block at sunset, buying bread for tea time. I felt guilty. I knew they rarely walked him. The thought crushed me.

Then one day in March, I ran into my mom. I was picking up my meds at the hospital near home and took the bus that runs through my neighborhood. She got on at the primary care stop. My heart started racing; I felt pins all over my body. Before I knew it, I was crying. She saw me, came to the back of the bus, and sat beside me. We cried loudly — sobbing, trembling — while everyone watched. I rested my head on her lap as she ran her hand through my hair. Time froze.

We got off at Plaza de Puente Alto and went to eat gohan — sushi al plato. Her eyes looked heavy, full of old pain. Later, she confessed that they feared I had left Chile the day I moved out. She worried I had no money. I couldn’t tell her about the debt or ask for help. It was my problem.

I didn’t go home with her that day, but my heart felt lighter. The back pain didn’t matter anymore. My soul had finally gotten what it needed.

Slowly, my mania gave way to depression. By April, I was hearing voices, hurting myself, and thinking only about death. I had recently started Prozac, and the first months were brutal. I applied for over a hundred jobs — no calls. Even after tailoring my résumé, nothing. With depression, I could barely function.

My partner began sending me small monthly transfers to cover rent. It wasn’t until I hit rock bottom that I realized how deep the hole was. I stopped using the card except for essentials. I ate the same thing every day: rice, lentils, spinach salad. Sometimes chicken.

That winter was long and cold. I lived alone on the sixteenth floor with my books, my drum kit, and my dog. I developed rituals to make the days bearable. I’d heat the bathroom, dim the lights, make coffee, toast bread, and fill the tub with hot water. I’d place my laptop on my drum stool and rewatch Princess Mononoke from the bathtub. Coffee mug on one side, grilled cheese on the other, a towel under the door to trap the warmth. Naked, I’d see myself reflected in the mirror across the room and feel at peace. It became my sanctuary — a ritual that made existence possible.

My new medication had my mood on the floor. Against my better judgment, I started ordering whiskey through delivery apps and making Irish coffee in the mornings. The adjustment had left me so anxious I could barely shop in person — I got everything delivered. The mix of whiskey and coffee gave me a calm, steady buzz that made writing possible.

By November, I decided to go back home.

I’d already been visiting once a week. My family was different now — gentler, more careful. They let me sleep all day if I needed to. But one night, during a church meeting they hosted at home, I broke down. I hid in my room, listening to their voices, their words — how fake and hypocritical they sounded when I thought of myself as queer. Rage took over. I tore apart a razor, cut my arms, then swallowed all my sleeping pills. I ended up in the ER with an antipsychotic shot.

The good news is that after that, I was never the same again. I began to heal, to read, to write, to know myself. My psychiatrist added a permanent antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. That combination worked. Life became livable again. I didn’t find a job until the following September, but I lasted a year before the contract ended.

Now, when I look back at those expenses, I don’t see waste. I see survival. Cafés became my therapy, my anchor, my mirror. I couldn’t afford that life, but those spaces helped me stay alive long enough to learn how to rebuild one.

Today, as I sit here listening to Hymn for the Weekend by Coldplay, I close this chapter. I’m free from debt, and from the chaos that created it. I don’t promise I’ll never fall again — but this time, I know what it costs to keep breathing underwater.

One thing I talk about above all else is providing yourself with food, water, and shelter right out the gate. We'll start with shelter because you can die overnight without shelter, then we'll cover water because you can only go days without water, and finally, we'll talk about food because apparently, you can live several weeks without food, although I've never gone more than three days.
By building myself a makeshift camper van before moving off-grid, I afforded myself shelter from the moment I pulled onto my land. Depending on where you're moving, this may not be an option, but that doesn't mean you should give up. Worst case scenario, you'll be required to install a septic system and build and permit a home. If that's what you have to do, it's just another way of reaching your end goal. Just look at it as a portion of the overall cost. You may be able to build out a shed, park an RV, or a tiny home on your land. These are all similar options that will yield a home for your homestead.
In addition to my camper van, the first shelter I built was my shop. Being under 200 sq ft means it doesn't require permits. It's basically a shed. It cost me about $4000 in materials. The main purpose was to store my tools, supplies, and food. In an emergency, I could stay in there as well. The shop created a surface to harvest rainwater, so connected the IBC totes for storage.
Other shelters included animal shelter, greenhouses, and the root cellar. Many systems on a homestead can be used for multiple purposes. I'll expand on these systems later. With shelter in place, I began to focus on water.

Water is life; it’s important to have a system for water right out the gate. For me, this meant having a trailer and a water tank so I could haul water until I built a large enough rain-harvesting system.
The next steps I took were to build my shop with a corrugated roof that would harvest rainwater and gutters that would direct this water to my IBC totes for storage. Installing wire mesh will keep pests from getting into the water storage; chlorine will kill bacteria, and filtration will remove impurities, including 99.9% of the chlorine you add.
I have been able to expand on my system as my homestead has grown. I dug underground cisterns that hold around 3600 gallons each. I also dug two ponds that hold about the same amount of water.
While the roof system diverts water to the cisterns, I have dug swales that direct water to the ponds. Utilizing my land to harvest water and direct it to the ponds significantly increases my ability to harvest and store rainwater. Currently, I’m capable of harvesting and storing 12,000 gallons annually.
To automate my watering system, I built a water tower approximately 20 feet above ground. This tower provides plenty of pressure to direct water to any part of my homestead with no problem. About once a week, I pump 330 gallons up to the tank on the water tower, and from there, all the animals and gardens have automated water, even if my solar system goes down.
Even my outhouse has a mini-system to harvest rainwater for a handwashing station. The 5-gallon container has never dried up since the first time it filled.

I have learned to raise and care for pigs and keep hundreds of pounds of pork on my homestead at all times. I no longer need to buy meat.

Moving off-grid with a camper van meant I had shelter before I arrived. You could do the same with an RV or trailer.
The first shelter I built on the homestead was my shop. You could build a home exactly the way I built my shop depending on where you live. I spent about $4000 on building materials.
Before building, I considered the topography of my homestead. I built where water would not accumulate, and when it finally did rain, I saw where water did accumulate and graded the driveway out towards swales that pull water away from my shop, into ponds. If you're anywhere near a flood plane, you should elevate your buildings to be above the possible flood level. Even if you're not on a floodplain, you should build on pressure-treated skids at the least. I didn't have much money, so I bought standard 4x4s and treated them with a fuel/oil mixture and torched them.
Your floor and walls should be framed on 16" centers. After stick framing the floor, you should sheet it with 3/4" flooring and build your walls on top of it. It's very windy here, so I buried 6 4x4 posts about 3 feet in the ground in the corners and center of my floor. I attached the walls to the posts.
I built rake walls on both ends with one side of the shop about one foot taller than the other. This way there is a pitch going away from what will be the center of the shop. On the opposite side, I built an awning that matched the pitch over the shop. This way I can park under one side and enclose a shop on the other side. I covered the roof in metal roofing so I could easily harvest rainwater to store in containers and cisterns.

It was just my dog Incus and I when I first arrived on my raw land. We both stayed in my camper van. The first animal shelter I built was for chickens.
Using scrap material, I framed a floor and created an arch with rewire (similar to cattle wire). In the back of the hoop house-styled chicken shelter, I built a two-story coop: the bottom for the chickens to lay eggs and the upper for them to retreat from the cold. All of the stick frame was 2x4, and I wrapped it with OSB. The stairways are simply OSB with strips of OSB for steps. In addition to the rewire, I wrapped the entire shelter in chicken wire. Wire mesh would be better to keep out snakes, but it's done the trick. My original concern was coyotes, so I wrapped the entire bottom in chicken wire to keep them out as well. The top back of the coop is covered with a billboard tarp. I buy them used, and they hold up well. The door is closed with a simple locking latch.
I keep the coop clean all year except in winter. I allow the compost to build up, which provides additional heat for the chickens. I have 5 hens that have been perfectly healthy in that shelter going on four years now.
I tried my hand with goats and pigs and decided I prefer the latter. Regardless, the pens and shelters remain the same. The first pen I built I used tree branches for posts and fenced in about a 30x10 area. In fact, this area started out as a garden.
I simply split the area in half and using pallets I built a three-sided shelter in each half and covered them in corrugated steel panels. I later added another pen roughly equal in size to the two original pens.
They're all wrapped in rewire, and at least the bottom foot is wrapped in 1/4" wire mesh to keep the piglets from escaping. I use these three pens to move the pigs around to breed them, keep them separate, and one for piglets that have aged out. This small system allows me to grow all the meat I need here on my homestead.

My first fence, like most everything else I built at first, was frugal and very basic. I built my gates from scrap material. This first fence served a few purposes: keeping my dogs in, keeping coyotes out, and painting a clear picture for humans that this is private property. The fence consisted of about half the T-posts you should use and no strong corner posts. I welded T-post corners knowing I would eventually upgrade them, but this original fence is still standing, doing its job. In fact, it keeps the horses from coming into the homestead from their pasture now, but I will upgrade it soon and build it the same way I have built the perimeter fence.
The original fence is 7 strands of poly electric fence wire. It's cheap, and it will jolt you. Animals touch it once and stay away. In order to make it work, you need a powerful charge controller to electrify the fence, and you need to place several grounding rods near the unit and around the perimeter.
The outer perimeter fence didn't come into play until I purchased horses. This fence needed to be strong. I used eight-foot, pressure-treated 4x4s for the corners and sides of gates. I placed one upright about three feet deep in concrete, then ran two more eight-foot 4x4s at about 45°, running parallel to the fence on either side, to brace the main post about halfway up. After all posts were set and cured, I ran three strands of high-tension wire starting from the bottom and working my way up around the entire perimeter. I ran two strands of poly wire to fill the gaps until I could afford to replace them with high-tension wire. This fence has held up perfectly, and I've had no trouble with the horses. Soon, I'll upgrade the original inner fence to match the perimeter fence.

With fencing out of the way, homestead defense is an important and overlooked quality any homestead should have. At a bare minimum, you should be armed for unexpected situations, be it a black bear that comes looking for dinner, an aggressive stray dog, or unsavory individuals.
My homestead has many layers of security, and I'll detail them for you now. By the time anyone gets within half a mile of my homestead, I know they're there. I have motion detectors set up half a mile away that notify me. Even if it's just a rabbit, I know. Again, at the end of my long drive, I have another sensor that notifies me with a distinctly different sound. If I'm feeling busy and ignore the first notification, I never ignore the second. Someone is definitely approaching my first gate. By the time someone approaches my driveway, they're already on live camera that is recorded to the cloud. Once someone is on my driveway, I can read their license plate and have video of their vehicle; by the time they approach my first gate, I can identify them inside their vehicle. 360° of my property and the property near mine is covered at all times.
I can communicate through the cameras if necessary, and so can any visitors. An added benefit to the cameras is that all my livestock and valuables are on camera as well. The fences provide more security by forcing visitors to stop at the front gate. This gate is about a quarter mile from my homestead, leaving them in a very vulnerable spot with nowhere to take cover while on my end, I have bulletproof dugouts around the perimeter of my homestead behind the second fence and gate. These dugouts are made with dirt, sandbags, and 3/4" steel structures. Behind all fencing, I have stacked old foliage, tree limbs, and more, making it impossible to get through without drawing a lot of attention. Inside my first fence is the horse pasture; my stallion and filly can definitely be intimidating, they’ll easily keep predators at bay and deter many people. Behind my second fence are three very sweet, well-trained dogs that are absolute animals when it comes to protecting their yard. The electric fence is an added bonus. And finally, all the gadgets a man might keep to protect himself can easily reach out and touch anyone before they even turn down my drive. Some have called me paranoid. I call myself prepared.

The cisterns are holes lined with tarps, with a tarp stretched over the top covered in timber with a manhole covered in another tarp that’s covered in earth.

Submersible pumps make it easy to pump water from the cisterns to the water tower or any other location on the homestead. The cisterns never freeze, making it possible to use this water year-round.

I have a float switch in the tower that activates the pump in the cistern when there’s about 50 gallons of water left in the water tower tank. The pump takes about an hour to fill the tank. With the tank full, I can water the homestead for about a week without running a pump.
The tower is simply 4 4x4 posts on a mound about 3 feet deep.

I built a simple handrail to prevent falling off the top after I built a crane to hoist the tank up. Painting the tank solid black prevents algae from growing in the tank, and because it’s in the sun, the tank only freezes a couple of days each year.

I have never bought amendments, compost, or soil to add to my soil here on the homestead. I have enjoyed the long, slow process of making my own. I wanted to experience the process of making everything possible from scratch as if I were out here completely alone. It has taken me nearly four years to create a garden large enough to provide most of my needs, filled with quality soil. If you did want a running head start, I would recommend simply hauling in a load of manure to compost.
It took time for me to accumulate enough livestock and foliage to make good compost. You could save a lot of time bringing your own.
On day one, I walked my property, collecting cow pies left behind by grazing cattle. I crushed the pies and rehydrated them. I mixed in straw, which was about the only foliage I had, and began the process. It took about six months to make my first batch of soil. In the meantime, I planted a full garden in native soil and it worked! The soil is loamy; however, it's not nutrient-dense or soft enough to grow carrots or potatoes very successfully. The trick is to add large amounts of organic matter to the soil. This will allow it to absorb and retain water and possess the nutrients your garden needs to thrive.
You can’t grow in pig manure right away; it needs to compost for six months to be sure you won’t get sick. Rabbit and goat manure, on the other hand, can be used right away. You can also make fertilizer with any of these manures. Simply fill about 1/3 of a 5-gallon bucket and top it off with water. Let it soak for a week, and you have fertilizer. You can use a ppm meter to make the exact formula you want and use specific manure for different NPK balances.

In order to block the wind, reduce direct sun exposure, increase humidity, and reduce the cold, a greenhouse is a must. You can grow during about a six-month period outside, but it’s a harsh environment. Once I had a greenhouse up, I was able to grow throughout the winter by placing plant fabric over the plants when it was below 25°F. Above that, most plants do fine. The greenhouse will also keep the dogs, cats, and mice at bay. Yes, even my dogs have eaten or damaged a lot of my trees and crops.
It's too windy out here to have much success with tent-style greenhouses, but if you stick frame a shed and wrap it in corrugated plastic, you'll have a sturdy structure that will hold up. I made tent-style greenhouses work when I had very little money, but eventually, it's best to stop replacing them annually.
My current greenhouse is about 10x20'. I placed sunshade cloth over the south side and the top to prevent extreme direct sun exposure. On top of that, I placed plant fabric, then the corrugated plastic. These layers are built-in and will stay up year-round. After experimenting in my garden, this has yielded good results throughout the entire year.
The most important thing to remember in a harsh environment, whether it’s hot or cold, is mulch. Mulch will keep the heat in, the cold out, and hold moisture. You can lose all that water you add in a single windy day. You may as well not try to fight Mother Nature and get the mulch built into your soil and top it off each time you plant. I like to put down fresh soil, then top it with ground-up straw, water it down, then apply another layer the next day and water it down again. This seems to really help, especially outside, to keep the mulch from blowing away. If you can build a solid wall around your garden, that will also help a lot. The wind is about the harshest thing you’ll have to contend with.

    Description = """
One of the first projects I started was a geothermal/walapini-style greenhouse. Typically, people build one or the other, but I decided to build them together. The walapini component is a below-ground-level greenhouse, while the geothermal component consists of 200 linear feet of 4" corrugated tubing buried about 3 feet under the lowest level of soil.
In addition to having a 600-gallon aquaponics system and the sunshade cloth and plant fabric layers, my geothermal system stays about 20 degrees warmer or cooler year-round. This makes a huge difference in extending the growing season through the full year.
The aquaponics system never freezes, and the plants thrive all year. In the winter, I close it off, and in the summer, I open it up to circulate the air.
I even placed a beehive inside that can be entered from inside or outside, and the bees did well in there until I opened the hive one too many times, and they swarmed.
Many people have voiced concern over the geothermal flooding, but as I dug it, I built up a 3-foot berm around the perimeter, and it has never leaked. Not even close. Also, the ground is largely caliche, which is made up of Portland cement, and it will not collapse.
Not only is the geothermal system very productive, it’s also one of my favorite spots to sit back and enjoy the fruits of my labor.
My aquaponics system is located in the back of my geothermal greenhouse, where less sun is able to directly hit it. The bottom tank is covered to prevent the sun from hitting most of the tank, and this greatly reduces algae growth. The bottom tank is a 400-gallon vinyl tank designed to hold fish. The upper tank is an old trailer that I lined with vinyl. Together, they hold about 600 gallons of water year round, which helps regulate the temperature in the greenhouse. The system acts like a giant thermal battery, which collects the heat of the day and slowly releases it all night to warm the greenhouse. The water has never frozen, even when it’s -10°F. In my location, I could keep Koi, bass, or bluegill easily. Trout would work as well; they just require more oxygen. Tilapia would not be a good choice as my water doesn’t get or stay hot enough. The system loses very little water to evaporation and only requires the occasional top off, which helps keep the water clean.
I built a simple bell siphon that allows the upper tank to fill to the top of the substrate before overflowing into the siphon, which activates it, and the water drains to the tank below. I have a 1600-gallon-an-hour pump that pumps the water back up to the top tank, and this cycle completes roughly every 15 minutes. This adds a lot of oxygen to the system and continually filters the water. It also prevents mosquitoes.
It took about six weeks to cycle the system before it was safe for fish. I planted mint right out the gate and eventually got some mosquito fish, which are small mosquito eaters. They died off during winter, but the previously named fish would thrive; I just haven't gotten to adding them yet.
My mint plants thrived all winter, and I've harvested a lot of mint from the system. It requires a decent-sized solar system to keep the pump running. About 600 watts of panels and 400Ah of battery should do the trick.
I've tried a few systems in there and have never been able to keep it running 24/7, but soon I'll connect the system to my wind turbine, and I think it will be enough to power everything.
The substrate I used was simply cinder rock; it was only about $30 for a truck bed full. It required a lot of rinsing to get all the loose red out, but it's worked well.
I’ve had a couple of mice fall in and die, but by keeping an eye out and removing them quickly, the system has never gotten out of whack.

Livestock can provide many benefits to your homestead: manure, food, hides, pest control, homestead defense, and more.
When I started out, I had very little experience with livestock. The experience of caring for dogs definitely helped.
The first livestock I purchased was baby chickens. It was warm enough to keep them without extra heat, so I got them a bit later in the spring. No matter what livestock you get, you'll need to prepare to care for them.
After a few months, chickens pretty much care for themselves aside from food, water, and cleaning up after them, but you need to keep an eye on them to prevent issues like fleas or separating them if they fight too much.
My hens each lay about 1-2 eggs a day, and five hens keep me pretty stocked up on eggs. In fact, I often feed eggs to my pigs and dogs.
I tried goats, but I found that they were just too loud for my liking. I'm homesteading largely for the peace and quiet, and in my small homestead, the goats knew my every move and would scream any time I made a peep, no matter how much I fed them. I'm not a big fan of the taste of goat either, so I phased the goats out after putting four of them in the freezer. With goats, I had to learn to trim their hooves, and their care was more demanding than chickens.
Shortly after starting with goats, I bought a breeding pair of Vietnamese potbelly pigs. They're a smaller breed that is easier to handle alone but still bred specifically for meat. I have enjoyed them much more. It's still tricky to castrate the piglets and catch adults and trim hooves occasionally, but overall they're very easy to care for and produce well. I have chosen to focus on producing pork as my main goal.
Many ask me why I don't have more livestock, and the main reason is that the more variety you have, the more complete setups you need: more waterers, more pens, more gear for each.
Currently, I keep chickens for eggs, pigs for meat, and I'm training two feral horses to be ridden. I plan to train them to pull a wagon and work around the homestead.
Horses are the most demanding livestock I've owned in many ways, but I believe they'll yield large dividends after I've trained them. In order to keep horses, I had to fence the perimeter of my homestead to create a pasture. I had to make sure the fence around my homestead was strong enough to keep them in. I built two stables, one for each horse, so I can keep them separate if need be or train them individually. I also built a round pen to train them to lunge and more. It's taken several months to train the horses, and I spend time doing so with them nearly every day, so it's a pretty large investment. They require feed three times each day.
One of the best rewards of keeping livestock is the manure they produce. I compost it and amend my soil with it, therefore having very nutrient-dense soil with no store-bought additives.

Chickens are pretty easy to keep, but babies need to be around 98°F for several weeks, requiring electricity. For this reason, I simply wouldn't get baby chicks until summer is approaching, maybe a bit earlier if you have hens that will care for them, but not all hens will. The electricity required to keep heat lamps going or to incubate eggs is just too demanding until you have a very large solar system, mostly because it has to run all night.
To protect your chickens from snakes and coyotes, you should wrap your chicken coop with 1/4" wire mesh. Chickens like to sit on a perch, so you should add a few to your coop. They enjoy dirt baths, so having a few inches of dirt at the base is beneficial; this is how they naturally repel pests. If you allow their manure to build up in fall, it will provide great insulation for them all winter, and after the temperature stops falling below 40°F at night, you can clean the compost out and keep it clean the rest of the year.
It's easy to build an auto waterer for your chickens; I only top mine off once a week, and you'll know if it's empty because they'll approach you when you walk by to let you know they need more. I have also built an auto feeder that lasts weeks at a time; it reduces waste and gives them something to do, pulling out a bit of feed at a time.
If you want to raise chickens, you’ll need a rooster to fertilize the eggs, but you may need to keep him separate because they can be very rough on the hens, removing all their back feathers. Also, most hens are bred to no longer be broody, which means they won’t make good mothers. You need hens that are broody if you want them to raise their chicks. Some breeds are much more broody than others.

Pigs are pretty easygoing, but piglets absolutely need to maintain about 98°F in the first few days. For this reason, I try not to have piglets unless it's getting close to summer or before fall. If you want to raise piglets, the mother or sow will need a partition at the back of her shelter. This partition gives the piglets a safe place to retreat to so they don't get squished and suffocated while still being able to feed.
After about two weeks, you'll want to castrate the male piglets. The way their testicles sit, you cannot simply band them like you can with goats. In order to make this easier, I built a platform with three pieces of wood, each a bit longer than the piglets and each a bit wider. I attached a door hinge to both sides of the center piece so I can lay a piglet on its back and tie the platform closed surrounding the piglet so it can't roll and move. With the piglet secured, I use a scalpel to slice a hole about 1/2 an inch in the scrotum. By gently pinching a testicle, you can see where to slice. Once you're through the skin, the testicle will pop out, and you can pull it out until the ductus deferens rips out. Most people simply spray the wound with purple vet spray and put the piglets back in the pen. I use sutures to close the wound. It's pretty easy, and if you use disposable sutures, you don't need to remove them.
The reason for castrating the piglets is apparently the meat will taste better, and you’ll prevent unwanted breeding. They will breed within months unless you prevent it. You may also need to separate the boar from the babies to prevent him from breeding or harming them.
If you need to bottle feed a piglet because it’s too small, or the mom isn’t doing a great job of caring for it, you can buy livestock milk feed and mix up the appropriate blend for piglets. They need to get as much colostrum from their mother right away. If they can feed for a day or two that would be best before you decide to bottle feed. The formula goes bad after 12 hours, so make sure to keep it fresh. You can use an eye dropper when they’re very small, a livestock bottle feeder, or a pan if you have nothing else.

I've never owned horses or really been around horses much until I bought mine recently. I bought a stallion mustang that is three years old and a filly quarter/mustang. Both were born on a large ranch to parents who were feral horses.
Neither of my horses had been handled before being placed into a trailer and delivered to my place. Feral horses are nearly wild horses, but at some point in their lineage, they had been domesticated.
After buying my horses, the first thing I did was build a couple of stables and a round pen to make sure I could house them. I added an automated waterer so they would always have water. Next, I began to fence the perimeter of my property. I received my stallion, Sage, first and had to keep him in the round pen and stables for one month while I installed the perimeter fence. Eventually, my filly, Ginger, was old enough to be weaned, and I brought her home as well. That first day, the horses ran and played together on their new pasture.
From day one with my stallion, I would pet him and spend time with him at least 30 minutes nearly every day. When I got Ginger, she was six months old. I let her run and play with Sage for a month before I began to work with her. My stallion spooks much easier than Ginger, and to this day, I haven't quite gotten the halter on him, but Ginger allowed me to halter her on my third attempt. What my stallion excelled at was lunging and learning to be gentle around me. After six months, I've almost haltered him, and I believe once he allows me to do that, we'll make a lot of progress. My filly has allowed me to halter her, lead her, place a saddle blanket on her back and a saddle; this past week, I was able to trim her hooves. She's way ahead of the curve. I don't plan to ride her until she's at least two years old. By then, she'll be very used to being handled.
I've learned that patience is the way with horses; you have to earn their trust. I've learned how to better interact with my dogs because of my horses. With the experience I've had, I believe if I get another horse, I'll be that much better at training it.
The horses go through about 25 gallons of water each day total and about 20 lbs of hay each. I give them about a cup of sweet feed occasionally because it's like a multivitamin, providing nutrients they may be lacking. I've also given them trace minerals and a de-wormer.
If you were to ask me how to train your horses, I would recommend starting with being around them. Petting them a bit if they'll let you and slowly progressing to being able to run your hand down their legs to eventually touching their hooves, belly, and rear end. If they spook at all, move back to a point where they were comfortable. If they love their ears or butt scratched, do that. It will show them that it feels good to be hands-on.
After some time, you can try to lunge them. By driving them around a round pen, you develop leadership like they do in the wild. They naturally want to be led, so you can teach them that you're the leader. Another way to do this is by taking their space in the pen. With a whip or a flag, you can walk to the spot your horse was standing, forcing them to move, slap the flag on the ground, and stand there, facing away from them. This shows them you're dominant and the leader. When you drive them around the pen, the moment they give you both eyes, stop and face away from them. This is rewarding them for giving their attention to you. You're teaching them that if they turn to face you, you'll back off. It's much easier to halter a horse's face than its rear end.
It's important to train your horse several days in a row. If you can't spend 30 minutes every day with them, then spend 30 minutes a day for at least three days in a row when teaching them something.
Next, I would start to introduce them to items; in a sense, you're starting to gentle them by doing so. Let them smell and touch each item before you touch them with it. Show them a brush, let them interact with it, then slowly try to brush them. Continue to work with them until you can do so. If at any time you're struggling with something for several days, move on and try something else. There will likely be certain things your horse won't let you do at first, but other things they will allow, and each horse may be different. So don't give up, just try something else if you have to.
In the same manner, you'll want to introduce the halter, and if you have to, you can use treats, but be careful not to train them to be pushy with treats. If they are pushy, stop giving treats and reaffirm your personal space with your hands or a flag to keep them back.
A younger horse will likely be much easier to train than an older horse, especially if feral, they will likely spook easier. Always be careful around them as even a baby can run you over. If they do something they shouldn’t, be assertive and tell them no, like you would a dog, but don’t lose your temper with them. Remember, as big and scary as they may seem at first, even a three-year-old is just a baby. Be gentle and patient, and they’ll come around.

Being able to safely store the food you grow on your homestead is an important part of the process. You can jerk meat to store for the long haul, glass fresh eggs for storage, can produce, and store perishable goods in your root cellar. There are more ideal locations than the high desert to install a root cellar, but even my frugal root cellar does a fine job of extending the life of my food stores.
At its roots, a simple root cellar is simply a hole in the earth with shelves, a door, and ventilation. My root cellar is roughly 8’x8’x8’. My land is loaded with caliche which makes it hold its shape well, but after digging a larger hole I lined it with sandbags to reach the size it is now. Ideally your root cellar should be 10–12 feet deep; mine is closer to 8.
I dug my root cellar by hand with a shovel and used the dirt I pulled out to build a berm around and over the top. It’s not perfectly ideal but it’s what I was able to do at the time, and I’m able to store fresh produce in there year-round.
There’s a manhole at the top. I’ve insulated the door with about 6 inches of foam to help maintain the temperature, and I’ve installed a 100w solar panel and 100ah battery to run a tiny fan 24 hours a day to reduce humidity. I also placed a motion-activated light inside so I can see what’s on the shelves.
People often ask if I’ve had any issues with mice, and after years of use, I have never had mice in my root cellar. It’s sealed off from outside pretty well, and it would be very difficult for a mouse to get in from the manhole.

By offering value to people for free, they may be more inclined to buy what you’re selling. If you are passionate about something, it will likely be your best product.
If you know a trade, such as carpentry, welding, or operating heavy equipment, those are all good sources of income. If you like to bake, you can make good income doing so. If you’re in a larger community, you can offer landscaping, snow removal, and handyman work.
In all of these scenarios, if you under-promise and over-deliver, you will get return customers.
You can earn income online or in person—better yet, you can do both. By creating several sources of income, you can build financial security.
Maybe you’d like to set up at a local farmers market. Your goal may be to build a large greenhouse so you can sell excess produce.
You can write books, create content, give most away, and sell some. And of course, you can always get a regular job if that’s what you’re best at.
What might be more important than how you make your money is how you spend it. Reducing your bills and overall costs makes it easier to budget for what you need, and if your needs are met, then aren’t you better off than the guy with a flashy home and car that he may never truly own?

When institutions explore emerging technologies like distributed ledger technologies and blockchains, they often gravitate toward private, permissioned solutions such as Corda or Hyperledger. However, recent news about growing interest from major players in public, decentralized blockchains suggests that practical applications are already beginning to emerge.
But are these truly decentralized systems, particularly Web3? And what about the challenges that public blockchains introduce? What does the near future hold for corporate banking transactions?
In this article, I share my professional journey that shaped my perspective and highlight the technologies I believe are best positioned to bring corporate transactions fully on-chain.
My perspective: where do I come from?
My passion for optimizing business processes and increasing profitability began at 19. I was determined to be competitive and had set my sights on reaching top management immediately after graduating from university. Since then, I’ve spent years helping banks, construction firms, and e-commerce companies grow their margins, while also improving the operational efficiency of government institutions.
At the height of my career in a private IT company, I saw a persistent bottleneck in payment gateways. The delays had become so entrenched that no one questioned them, but I did. I knew things could be faster.
This led me to take on the role of Product Owner for the digital services at Elcard (https://ipc.kg/), the national payment system of Kyrgyzstan. Over the next several years, my team and I launched a wide array of digital solutions and established ELQR as the central QR hub for interbank payments across the country.
Yet even with all these advancements, the core issue remained: businesses were still not receiving funds in real time. The inefficiencies had become so normalized that even the suggestion of an instant alternative was often met with skepticism. Whether real-time settlement truly leads to higher profitability remains an open question, one I intend to explore in my next piece. I have now joined the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, where I work on research and development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the underlying technology of which will be blockchain, and the payment will be a settlement.
Corporate transactions on the blockchain
During my participation in the DLT Talents programme from Frankfurt School of Finance and Management Blockchain Center, JPMorgan introduced a compelling concept: using a stablecoin-like token, JPMD, to offer institutional clients faster, more seamless fund transfers on-chain. This announcement marked a key shift in the conversation.
So, corporations that want to increase process efficiency and explore blockchain technologies often turn to private blockchains. To meet regulatory requirements, the most heavily regulated players tend to build proprietary systems, where onboarding and customization can take up to a year, even for mid-level developers. However, the JPMorgan case introduces another option: Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of public blockchains. Was it about enabling real business use cases in a compliant, interoperable manner? Let’s try to explore the technologies behind.
Possible technologies behind the corporate banking transactions on-chain
Layer 2
Blockchain can offer a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional IT systems for a variety of purposes, including secure information exchange, controlled data access, and transparent transaction recording. To address the core scalability, improve transaction speed, and reduce the transaction cost, there is an increasing interest in Layer 2 solutions that can be deployed on top of the public blockchains. Layer 2 solution allows off-chain processing to increase transaction throughput and minimize the number of transactions recorded on the Layer 1 blockchain in order to reduce fees.
Types of Layer 2 solutions
State channels enable transactions between parties without requiring each transaction to be recorded on the mainnet. Only the final state of the channel is recorded on-chain, significantly improving the efficiency. Examples: Bitcoin Lightning network, Ethereum’s Rauden Network.
Sidechains are separate blockchains that run parallel to the main chain (Layer 1), and they don’t directly inherit Layer 1 security. On the contrary, they offer their solutions for security and consensus mechanisms. Examples: Polygon (Ethereum), Liquid Network (Bitcoin).
Rollups aggregate multiple transactions into a single transaction, which is then submitted to the main chain. Rollups inherit the security of Layer 1 while processing transactions off-chain. Examples: Arbitrum (Optimistic), zkSync (ZK-Rollups), Optimism (Optimistic).
ERC-2771 and ERC-5564
ERC-2771, in other words, the Meta-transaction solution was designed to address making calls from externally owned accounts (EOAs) without paying transaction fees, the gas fees covered by third parties (forwarders). The purpose of using the meta transaction could be to address the privacy issues, especially for corporate deals. With this Ethereum standard, the user signs a message off-chain, and the relayer contract submits it on-chain, covering the gas fee. This design was primarily introduced to improve the usability (gasless transaction) and onboarding. However, the interesting side effect of ERC-2771’s shield is that it protects the user’s on-chain identity because all meta transactions appear to originate from the forwarder’s address, not the end user’s address on the block explorers. Additionally, for the recipient, the ERC-5564 stealth address could be used.
Are these truly decentralized systems?
The promise of WEB3 was simple but ambitious: decentralize ownership, control, and value transfer, replacing intermediaries with code. In reality, the systems we call “decentralized” often rely on a complex mix of centralized components: trusted validators and infrastructure providers. Even popular public blockchains can have points of centralization: governance power concentrated in a small group of token holders, reliance on a few node operators, or dependency on centralized oracles and hosting services. All the above technologies for corporate deals are more likely the WEB2.5 technologies rather than WEB3.
Near future for corporate banking transactions on-chain
In the next few years, expect more hybrid blockchain architectures: public networks for settlement and verification, combined with permissioned layers or zero-knowledge modules for privacy and compliance. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and regulated stablecoins will increasingly serve as settlement assets, enabling atomic delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions entirely on-chain.
Major financial institutions are already piloting these approaches, JPMorgan’s JPMD deposit token on a public Layer 2 is a prime example. If these models prove reliable, corporate adoption will accelerate, with on-chain deals moving from pilots to production in trade finance, loans, cross-border payments, and supply chain contracts.
The real question is not whether corporate deals will happen on-chain, they will, but how decentralized the infrastructure will truly be, and how effectively we balance openness with the operational and regulatory realities of global business.

James Madison: The architect of a system that could survive
Most people meet Madison as the soft-spoken intellect behind the U.S. Constitution, The Federalist Papers and The Bill of Rights. A thoughtful designer in an era of loud personalities… it’s a tidy version of him, and it’s true, but it leaves out important details that earn him a place in this series.
Madison spent his early career watching a country lose its footing. Under the Articles of Confederation, states behaved like independent rivals. New York taxed goods coming in from New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland fought over navigation rights. Each state was convinced it saw the situation correctly and expected the rest of the country to comply. Of course, it didn’t work that way, and what emerged instead was a tangled mess of competing systems that produced exactly the kind of chaos Madison feared.
Then came Shays’ Rebellion. A small group of farmers in Massachusetts pushed the state close to collapse over debt policy. Madison noticed how little it took to shake the whole system, and that moment told him more about the country’s stability than any debate ever had.
He saw the same instability inside Virginia. Religious groups (Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians) each fought to define public life according to their own doctrine. Each new majority produced a new attempt to legislate certainty. It convinced Madison that no group, no matter how principled, can be trusted with the whole system.
These observations led to a very important insight:
People don’t balance themselves. Their interests need to be balanced for them.
His education was important in helping him articulate this.
Montesquieu warned about concentrated power.
Hume explained why factions form and why they don’t disappear.
The Scottish Enlightenment taught him that complexity survives by distributing conflict rather than suppressing it.
So Madison built a republic that relied on a balanced system.
A large republic makes it harder for any one group to dominate.
Layered governments force negotiation instead of obedience.
Separate branches introduce friction to keep hardline views from turning into authority.
Even procedural delays weren’t accidents; they acted as insulation.
Building and planning for durability, however, meant he could build for unity.
And this is the part of Madison worth remembering: he understood that certainty is a destabilizer. Once a group believes it sees the whole picture, it stops feeling like it needs to listen. Once listening stops, balance goes with it. And after balance, legitimacy is a fast follow.
The system he designed survives because this heavy load is distributed. We only really notice his work when someone tries to remove that balance.

Elinor Ostrom usually appears in the public imagination as the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. She spent her career far from academic models and closer to the places where cooperation was something people needed in order to eat, drink, farm and survive.
Her research took her into forests in Nepal, irrigation systems in Spain, fishing communities in Turkey and water boards in Los Angeles. Each place had the same problem in a different scenery: a shared resource, a mix of competing interests and the constant possibility that one group might push its agenda far enough to throw everything off balance.
Ostrom watched closely at how these communities behaved. She noticed that the systems that worked well weren’t run by a single leader or by a perfectly unified community. Instead, they relied on rules that spread responsibility across the people who depended on the resource(s). Boundaries were clear. Rules were shaped by the people who had to live with them. Monitoring was handled locally. Disputes were settled quickly. And when conditions changed, the rules changed with them.
These were places built by people who understood imbalance because they felt it the moment it appeared. That’s the heart of Ostrom’s contribution: Balance works when it’s shaped by the people closest to the problem.
She saw that when decision-makers were at a distance from the decisions they were making, they had a confidence they hadn’t earned. The closer they were to the problem, the more careful they were with the solution.
Ostrom also paid attention to the early signs that signaled a system was in trouble. If a single group found ways to steer the rules in its favor, the system lost its ability to balance out. The worst failures happened when outsiders stepped in with a single fix and applied it everywhere. Solutions that looked great from a distance often unraveled the arrangements that had kept the community stable.
This confirmed something Madison understood intuitively: balance doesn’t maintain itself. It has to be built. And it’s built best through local negotiation, small adjustments, and shared constraints that prevent any one perspective from becoming the entire truth.
For her, balance was more resilience than a moral posture. And the places she studied didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that. They depended on it.

Mahmood Mamdani isn’t a household name, but his work explains something most people feel without knowing how to articulate it: Societies don’t fall apart because people disagree. They fall apart when disagreement becomes fused with identity, when categories replace systems.
Where Madison studied factions and Ostrom studied shared resources, Mamdani studied the aftermath. He saw that societies fracture when political life hardens around identity categories instead of rules, negotiations, and shared institutions. Once identities become rigid, the categories do the thinking for you.
His work in East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East circled the same dynamic: When politics operate through identity rather than structure, balance disappears. Colonial administrations created durable divisions by labeling people as “natives” or “settlers,” assigning rights and responsibilities based on category instead of citizenship. Everything that followed—representation, punishment, land allocation, even definitions of violence—flowed from the category, not the behavior.
The pattern was consistent:
People stopped seeing one another as individuals and began treating each other as types. Arguments became personal because they tied directly to who someone was, not the merits of the argument itself. Each group insisted that its identity determined the rules.
Once a system is organized around identity, laws begin to formalize conflict instead of stabilizing it. Public life shifts from negotiation to competition over whoever controls the categories closest to power.
This is Mamdani’s core warning: When a group can define categories, it no longer needs to define the argument. The system itself carries the argument for them.
Examples illustrate the mechanics:
In Rwanda, colonial powers turned fluid identities into fixed racial categories, replacing negotiation with inherited status and leaving the society permanently destabilized. In Sudan, tribal classifications reshaped land rights and obligations, ensuring that every political conflict would be interpreted through ethnicity. In Uganda, colonial patterns created a split between citizenship and identity, guaranteeing that most disagreements would escalate rather than resolve.
Different regions, same mechanism: certainty hardened into identity becomes a destabilizer.
This connects directly to the broader argument:
Madison warned against dominance by a single group. Ostrom showed how shared rules and distributed responsibility prevent imbalance. Mamdani shows what happens when none of that holds—when people collapse a complex political system into rigid categories and defend those categories as if survival depends on them.
This explains our modern reflex: when expanding someone’s frame feels like an attack. Nuance looks like betrayal, and balance? That starts to resemble disloyalty.
People aren’t inherently unreasonable. Their political identity is simply doing too much work. Once identity carries the whole argument, the entire system begins to slide.

It felt like the beginning of a new stage of life. I was scrolling on Facebook and saw that an old schoolmate posted his mother’s obituary. Are we at that stage of life already? I thought.
Soon, social media was feeding me more obituaries of mothers and fathers who followed her to the grave, people who I once called “Mr.” and “Mrs.” from the back of mini-vans.
The roles reversed long ago. One day, we called our parents for help. The next, we were the adults who cared for our aging parents. We laughed at their quirky habits that drove us crazy. We talked about cable bills and Roth IRAs at parties. We thought about who would take care of them if something happened to us.
Now, they were leaving.
Next came the divorces. Friends who married in high school and had children decided to part ways, not because they didn’t try but because they had tried everything and couldn’t figure it out.
There were addictions. Children with mental health issues. Fertility problems. It would start with a grown-up problem and the scripture passages on Instagram inevitably followed. My social media feed once littered with party pictures. Now, it’s Mary Oliver poems and twelve-step quotes.
This isn’t just my religious friends. It’s the partiers. The chronically single people who moved to the city for important jobs. The intellectuals.
As I approach my forties, it’s happening more. My middle aged peers are rediscovering spirituality.
When we were young, spirituality and morality were fused into one overwhelming domain of life. Good behavior earned one a connection with a higher power. The goodies carried their crosses. The baddies mostly seemed to care about crosses when it came time to get a tattoo.
When I worked as a counselor for people on work release, some skeptical prisoners had a word for religion that is discovered while in crisis. They called it “jailhouse religion” and wrote it off as something cheap and easy. “Why didn’t you read the Bible before?” they said.
It takes what it takes, I’d say, shrugging. I believe that God will use any means necessary to find us.
In my adult world, the split between “good” and “bad” has all but disappeared. The bad kids are posting scripture passages and the good kids are deconstructing their beliefs. Everyone is searching for something, not because we’ve earned anything, but because some life made us feel powerless and sent us looking for something other than our own way of proceeding.
I wouldn’t call it a mid-life awakening. I’d call it a deepening.
A lifelong Catholic who went to church every week told me that he discovered real spirituality after getting a DUI and attending AA. “That was just checking a box,” he told me, of his church-only days. “But character flaws, accountability, acceptance…this is the real spiritual stuff.”
A dear friend told me how battling her husband’s mental health issues as a team brought them closer together. They learned to talk about vulnerable things, support each other when things get hard and that their relationship could withstand long periods of strife. “It was like holding the iron to the fire,” she told me. “It was hard, but it brought us much closer.”
John of the Cross called it “the dark night of the soul.” Twelve step programmers call it “rock bottom.” Addicts and mystics seem to acknowledge it more than many speaking from pulpits, but spiritual gold is indeed hiding in the dark parts of life.
One mentor told me that by the time we reach our thirties, our sins are our sins. Most of us will take some of them to the grave. And increasingly, I see those deeply embedded wounds not as a barrier to God but as an access point. When we hit our limits, grace tends to follow.
As a therapist, I see it most starkly in people grieving. When someone loses a spouse or a father, they start connecting to the world in a new way. They don’t want to avoid pain, because it’s the pain that connects them to someone that they love. Instead, they learn to walk around with it. And once they stop resisting the pain, it becomes something else.
For some, pain offers a kind of surrender. One woman in a grief group told me that she was stuck. Once she stopped resisting her stuckness, she realized she was stuck for a reason and learned to embrace stillness.
For others, pain becomes a bittersweet balm and a magnet for a different kind of love, the kind of love that a child gets from his parents after an injury or a loss. A nun once described God as her father patting her back after the death of a beloved pet. There, there.
For others, pain simply connects them to a deceased loved one. And letting go of the pain would mean letting go of their love.
For those who have learned to grieve, the goal of life is no longer to feel good. It is to love — no matter what that feels like.
I don’t know when we reduced a religion based on the life of a brutally murdered Jewish man — one who was despised during his lifetime and died naked on a cross — into something aspirational. Or when religious platitudes like “everything happens for a reason” replaced a faith that has always included space for suffering.
It is fundamental to the Christian story that the way up is down. That suffering and death can be redemptive. That if one clings too long to the illusion of self-sufficiency and upward mobility, they may miss the upside logic of the Christian world, where the last are going to be first and death leads to new life.
Pain is part of the spiritual life. One never seeks it, but it always finds its way to those who are doing the risky work of living and loving. It has something to offer, if only we let it in.

Peace, like taut thread, snapped when the white men crested the hill.
Old white men, they were, their bodies a rolling landscape of skin pulled tight and fallen loose. Pockmarked with moles and freckles, splotches of red, white, blue, and green, colors and shapes that hide behind the skin and fat of younger men. When they smiled, their eyes would become lost in the wrinkles and cracks of their brow.
The signs of wear on their bodies brought unease to the others in the field, like seeing the photos of improvised weapons of murder found after the act; unmeaning objects, now crumpled and cracked from their misuse. Spattered with dried-brown bloodstains that would tell you the sickening story of their journey, how they rushed out of body into open air, in a language that finished the thought before you ever had a chance to close your eyes and cover your ears.
The white men were spattered as well, with medals. Bright embroidery, silver and gold, a pox that had spread from their lapels onto their shoulders and across their chests. Covering the mute-green uniforms that had failed to age with their owners, attempting in vain to conform to bodies that had sloughed away decades ago. The medals spoke a language as well, but one known only by the white men. You could approach them, ask them to translate the meanings of this strip of turquoise and the gold stars and that shining scarlet ribbon, and they would point to this one and that and tell you exactly what happened where on what day; but those that couldn’t understand the medals could still pick words out of the slurry; words they remember from their conversations with the bloodstains.
Mai had never seen the white men at this monument. Her age, her story. Her grandfather died here.
She watched on as the white men trundled up the hill in a loose mass, too tired to form the even, single-file lines of their heyday. Upon reaching the even ground at the top, they spread outwards, each ambling around in their own aimless direction. Some followed the paths circling the flowers, others headed to the monolith in the center of the field.
Callum stayed at the edge, near the entrance. He scratched his white hair, unkempt and uncut. Some twenty years before this, he lost his desire to keep up his appearance. This had coincided with the loss of anyone he ­believed he needed to look good for. At home, he spent his days painting, landscapes and portraits that he would hide from his children out of embarrassment. He looked towards the monument and squinted, imagining how he would paint the large black stone. Though he would make no effort to paint it, he still measured the angles that he would need to convey the towering mass that stood some fifty paces away.
The monolith was made of a dark gray stone, tall and narrow, with rough sides, like it was pulled out of some larger boulder. One side was cut and polished smooth, with names engraved into it. None of the text was in English, but the white men that had gone over to observe the statue knew the things it said: given the field surrounding it, it was undoubtedly one giant gravestone.
For this was a field of Warflowers, which sprout only where blood has been spilled. Throughout the world, places of violence are marked by thick patches of deep burgundy, a flower that cannot be unrooted, a flower that will not wither nor shrink, no matter how much it is poisoned, salted, or tilled. The world fears the Warflowers, whose image gives pause to those who lament the end of things, of people. Some will cover patches in white gossamer, some will crouch and stare at the flowers in silent contemplation, drowning in their smell. Some see them as a taunt for the grieving. Some see them as the soul of their fallen warrior.
The locals silently questioned how the white men saw the Warflowers. They rarely took their eyes off them, with stern and solemn expressions on their faces. Some bent over to get close to the flowers, but none took a knee or sat in their presence. It was if the flowers had some authority over them, like they were a superior they couldn’t regard casually, at least not while they were on duty. More than anything, their treatment of the flowers was alien.
The presence of white men in these parts was not a rare occasion, but it still felt somewhat significant whenever it happened. This was because the white men did not blend into the area around them, they did not feel as if they were where white men are meant to be. They themselves seconded this idea, coming to this place only as tourists and foreigners, determined to demarcate themselves from those around them. Every meal they ate and event they attended would be followed by comparisons to their home country, to paved streets and sterile kitchens.
Mai was not yet sure what she thought of the white men. Opposing waves crashed against each other within her body. Boiling anger rose from her stomach, meeting a cold desire for peace that poured down from her temples. As she had always done, she looked to her mother.
Her mother’s face was pulled together. She was squinting in the sun, contributing further to the crow’s feet she had noticed two weeks ago and summarily began obsessing over. Mai understood the expression on her mother’s face wholly. She had seen it several times before: when Mai had broken a pot, when she had badmouthed her tutor, when she had brought home an older boy who smoked and made his money scamming tourists out of their passports. It was a look of disappointment, a disappointment that would have been shame if she didn’t love the perpetrator as much as she did. However, Mai’s mother did not aim her expression solely at the white men; she swept it across the field indiscriminately, hitting Mai and everyone else in the crossfire. Mai’s eyes locked with her mother for a moment as the typhoon inside of her swelled to a peak.
A hoarse shout tore through the contemplative silence of the field. The men turned their heads and began to make their way towards the source of the voice, a stout man in uniform holding a canvas bag. They ebbed slowly through the crowd of people, careful not to bump or push anyone. Upon reconvening at the head of the field, between the sun and the granite pillar in the center, the leader clapped his hands- once, loudly. He gave an order to the others, speaking in a jovial tone with a smile on his face.
“Line up, Boys! We have to get a new picture. Everyone remember where they stood?”
Callum remembered exactly where he needed to be. One away from the left end, in the front row. Right of McDowell, an ever-cantankerous man from Upstate who snored loudly, and left of Eames, a man with thick smile lines and a dirty joke to tell, no matter how inopportune the moment. He weaved through the pack until he reached the far end, looking to his right and seeing McDowell already staring forward towards the camera. He turned to the left and saw nothing the forest that stretched outwards past the field. He had forgotten.
After the movement subsided, the captain reached into his canvas bag and pulled out a camera while the men froze in anticipation. Some smiled, others couldn’t. The camera gave a soft click, and after a beat, the men unwound, slouching their backs and loosening their tight smiles. Again, they encircled the leader, who had reached into his canvas bag. Delicately, he lifted out a stack of brown paper sheets. He began to pass out individual sheets to the men, taking care to not crease the paper.
The first man to take the paper was broad, with closely shaven hair. Sheet in hand, he turned toward the center of the field, near the obelisk, where the largest patch of Warflowers sat. He approached the patch, kindly regarded the locals already there, and knelt. Then, with a swift and decisive hand, he reached into the patch and began to pick the flowers, placing them into his brown paper.
The locals stirred into a silent frenzy. Through quick glances, they questioned the man’s audacity, insulted his family, and lambasted his appearance. The older members failed to return the surprised glances, some responding with disappointment and others solemnly refusing to meet gazes at all. They were used to this tradition, and they would not join in on the bottled anger and confusion. They saved their energy and preserved the peace.
Mai looked on in horror. The waves inside her rushed into her mouth. She clenched every muscle in her face to combat the pressure that built behind her lips. She looked again to her mother. Do you see now? Do you see why I did not trust them? Her mother’s face had not given in to the silent mob, and she held strong her contemptuous gaze, now directed at a patch of dirt in between her legs, one Mai doubted she felt that strongly about. Inside her mind, Mai was gasping for air, reaching out for some safe land after her mother, the island, had fell below the waves. Mai was lost, because her mother was not.
As Mai floundered, the other men each took their sheets of paper and moved to their own designated patch of warflowers, ranging in size and shape. They picked enough flowers to form thin bouquets, between one and three for each patch, depending on the size. The locals struggled to maintain the taut thread of peace that ran through the air. As much as each person wanted to stand up and begin shouting, doing so would cut the thread that hung above their heads. That thread brought comfort to the dead that lie here; it mattered more than individual flowers and justice for sick men. And so, the men were left to their rites, passing out papers till only one remained.
Callum took the last sheet from the captain’s outstretched hand. He remembered exactly where he needed to be. A patch on the back left edge of the field, distant from the others and closest to the wall of trees that encircled them all.
Only one other person attended these flowers: a girl, in her late teens. She sat cross-legged at the edge, staring deeply, unfocusing her eyes and seeing only a hazy patch of red.
The man’s arrival did not break Mai from her trance. She saw him approach as if she was on the other side of the field. He stood before her as a blur of olive and white. He slowly, carefully lowered to one knee and gazed at the Warflowers, setting his paper flat on the ground. Softly, he ran his cracked fingers over the tops of the flowers, as if caressing the plants.
He swept across the flowers until his hand found its place to stop, and lowered beneath the sea of petals, towards the stems. His thumb and forefinger closed upon the neck of his desired flower, and he pulled it free from the rest, spinning it in his fingers before laying it into the paper.
Before he could find a second flower, Callum’s hand was wrestled away by the young girl. Her intense stare had moved to him, lodging barbs into his chest and holding tight. Her face shifted into one of reserved anger. She spoke in harsh words, refusing to care for the peace around her.
“▒▒▒! ▒▒▒▒▒▒? ▒▒▒▒▒!”
Callum didn’t speak her language, but perfectly understood the sentiment. He pulled back from the patch and began to stammer as those nearby turned their heads towards the commotion.
“No, it’s—”
“▒▒▒▒▒▒▒, ▒▒▒!”
Mai could barely think as the ocean inside her poured out of her mouth. She berated the man’s gall and audacity. He was sick. He was ugly. He was evil. She wished that the waves would push him on his back and bury him within the soil. She did not stop until the man dug into his pocket and frantically pulled out a crumpled photo.
In the photo stood a line of men, at least twice as large as the group in the field. They all stood tall, with arms over every shoulder. Some men were smiling, others couldn’t. The man held the photo close to the woman’s face and used the nail of his pinky finger to point out a small, blurry face in the photo. He lowered the photo, and his hand moved to point towards the Warflowers.
The girl fell back onto her knees, her face pulled tight. She sat for a moment—silent, skewered by the surrounding gazes—before turning towards the plants, and reaching out. She quickly found a flower—unblemished, with striations of pale blue—pulled it from the ground, and held it in her hands. She looked towards the man and presented the flower, holding it in the light.
As the girl’s words fell away, Callum felt a conflict of faith. He had wanted nothing more than for the girl to stop, for the dozens of eyes needling his back to let up. But he knew that if there was a God, He would have compelled this girl to keep going. Down from the heavens, He would send a bayonet, delivering it into the girl’s hand for her to drive into his heart with divine fury and justice. This girl had every right to kill him, every right that Callum had had to kill her father, or her uncle or her mentor.
He remembered the day he came home, in the open bed of a truck moving much too slowly down the main streets. The people had stretched their hands out to him and his brothers, screaming and cheering. Confetti and champagne had rained down on his head and he hoped that God had simply misplaced the sulfur and fire he was owed. He was sick. He was ugly. He was evil. He knelt in that field of Warflowers, looked down at that girl and begged God to set him alight and give her a sign that there truly is good in the world.
The air around him turned orange, and Callum looked up in anticipation of the wrath that would soon fall upon him. He saw no descending fury, and his face fell. He turned to the setting sun and began to berate it for pulling such a trick. His curses were cut short as the sun spoke in a voice that filled Callum’s ears and soul:“Just you wait, asshole. You’ll get yours.”
Mai kept her hand outstretched as the man stared at the sun. She watched his blank expression pull into a smile, before turning back to face her. The man accepted the flower, placing it into the paper sheet, on top of the crumpled photo. The two continued the ritual, passing the flowers as one by one, the people in the field pulled away from them and resumed their own rites.
Once a small bouquet had been assembled, the man pulled out a strip of olive canvas and tied the paper together. He thanked the girl and apologized, like she could understand. He rose, walking towards the group that had began to reform. The others turned towards him, meeting him with beaming smiles as if they too had heard God’s promise. Each man held one or more thin bouquets in their arms, all tied with green cloth.
All together, they reminisced, orating the tired stories of the men cradled in their arms. They laughed as they held their brothers tightly. The group was finally whole again.
Most certainly, some flowers of other men were nestled in the bouquets. The patches were thick, and the memories were foggy. But in the bouquets, those strangers are brothers too, innocent once again. For dying is a soldier’s only true penance; his only true baptism, in his own blood.

    Description = """There are few universal expressions that cross all human cultures,but I’m pretty sure this is one of them.Children have been complaining of boredom to their parents for hundreds of years.For much of that time,the go-to answer from most parents has been some combination of “do more chores” or “go outside and play.”More recently,however,these tried and true responses are being replaced by the siren song of screen time.Is this just a result of humanity’s love affair with technology,or have larger homes and convenience-based lifestyles eroded all other options?When we decided to buy our home,we joked that the only parts of the house that we remembered from the tour were the basement and the backyard.After looking at over 30 houses,we had become a little obsessed over whether a place had a solid foundation,so the basement made some sense.It was the backyard that had won over our hearts though.It was a beautiful September day when we first viewed the house,and,with no fencing separating the two sides of the semi-detached units,the shared backyard space was a glorious expanse of grass,wildlife and children’s play equipment.Our soon-to-be neighbours had small children of similar ages to us.Garden boxes were planted with vegetables.Goldfinches were coming to feeders.Children were climbing on wooden structures.This was the place for us.If we were looking for a newer house though,the options available would likely not have melted our hearts.Maybe we look for different things in a home than the average person,but builders seem to think that backyards are no longer a top selling feature.Increasing urban density and land prices,combined with a cultural preference for larger homes with more indoor living space,have resulted in backyards becoming smaller with every new-build.As houses expand on ever smaller lots,backyards are being sacrificed at the altar of indoor comfort.Yoga spaces,media rooms and home offices are taking the place of fenced-off outdoor areas as the de facto retreats from the higher usage parts of a house.Where people used to leave the home to exercise,watch movies and work in the company of others,and backyards provided a private space to enjoy nature at their leisure,these preferences have now switched.Once social activities have become private affairs,and the enjoyment of nature,if someone still thinks to do so,requires travelling to a public park or play area.Of course,this only concerns those of us fortunate enough to own a house in the first place.Smaller dwellings like apartments,condos and townhouses,replaced backyards with balconies and shared courtyards long ago for the sake of affordability.The high cost of housing has reached crisis levels in many areas,requiring people to adjust expectations and make tough choices as to where and how they will live.It is one thing to make a conscious choice based on the options available to you.It feels different when the choice is taken away from you completely.Boredom researchers Dr.James Danckert and Dr.John Eastwood describe boredom as “the uncomfortable feeling of wanting to engage in satisfying activity but being unable to do so.”According to this definition,boredom is not about lacking something to do,but rather lacking a feeling of satisfaction over the options available.The reduction of outdoor spaces like backyards is removing many of the options that have traditionally been available to help vanquish boredom,and replacing them with temperature-controlled isolation chambers where we suppress our boredom through the dopamine hits from phone scrolling and video games.Maybe some people find satisfaction in these technological options,but many of us feel like something is missing.Boredom plays an important role in society.From an evolutionary perspective,a species that gets bored may have an advantage over other species that are content with a more repetitive status quo.Getting bored encourages you to seek out new experiences like checking out whether that mushroom is edible or heading across that river to see what’s on the other side.Sure there may be some mishaps along the way,but it only takes a few successes to benefit the species as a whole.We may be making great boredom-inspired advances in the digital world these days,from cyber-espionage to artificial intelligence,but we are moving further away from our connection with the natural world.Having grown up before the rise of smart phones and the Internet,I have had the pleasure of being bored for a significant portion of my life.It might not feel like a pleasure when you are in the midst of it,but in retrospect I find being bored often leads to new and interesting endeavours.Picking up a new book.Starting a new project.Figuring out the answer to a lingering problem.As a child,the solution to my boredom often involved going outside and making use of a backyard.Playing baseball or Prisoner with kids on the street.Having crabapple fights.Climbing a tree.Before I saw them as ecosystems teaming with life,backyards were the safe havens away from parental supervision where memories and friendships were made.As backyards disappear from the urban landscape,the ecological and social services that they provide are disappearing with them.How a backyard is used evolves over a family’s lifetime.When kids are small,they are safe havens for parents and children alike.Small features seem huge in the eyes of a child,and a sandbox,tree stump and flower garden may take on outsized importance as truck stops,thrones and hiding spots in their imaginations.Equally as important,the knowledge that their children can safely explore within the controlled confines of a private space provides parents with both enormous relief and greater flexibility to manage household tasks unencumbered by a child’s boredom.As the kids grow up,a backyard might go through several iterations.Swimming pool,trampoline park,jungle gym,vegetable garden,badminton court,fire pit,campground,sliding hill,dog run,graduation ceremony…the list goes on.Once kids are no longer the main consideration,a backyard might transform into a social space to host BBQs and cocktail parties,or maybe a back-to-nature refuge for gardeners,birders and moth enthusiasts.Through it all,it will provide a host of ecosystem services that will likely go unheralded,from stormwater management to shady temperature control to wildlife habitat.While fences and hedgerows allow us to imagine our backyards are private sanctuaries hived off from the surrounding neighbourhood,your non-human neighbours see them for what they truly are:a core component of the interconnected yards,paths and green spaces that make up the urban ecosystem.So what happens when they no longer exist?Even with a backyard,I still get stuck in the dopamine trap of staring at my phone.I recognize my addiction,and I’m working on it.In the meantime,I’m trying to use my phone as a gateway back to the natural world.Using apps like iNaturalist and Merlin has opened my eyes to the flora,fauna and funga around me,helping to get me out of my house and back into nature.As my brain gets calibrated to recognize patterns in leaf shapes and bird calls as readily as I recall emojis and ringtones,I find that my phone stays in my pocket for longer periods of time as I am out on walks or puttering around the yard.Learning about the diversity in my backyard has started me on a journey of discovery,and while I still may have my phone with me as a tether to the virtual world,I have left boredom behind at home.""",

    Description = """
By now,you might already know about the problem of 2 Worlds and dealing with tons of digital content.You might also have an overview of the approach to handling it.
In this article,I will cover more about how to organize the information flow within the note-taking application.In my case,I’ll be working with Apple Notes.Due to its simplicity,you will reproduce the approach easily in any other application.There is by the way a separate article on why I believe the Apple ecosystem overall is awesome for managing digital information nowadays.
So,during the day you deal with tons of different pieces of information coming from all kinds of sources.If you work in an organization,especially in some manager roles,the amount of information and incoming requests might be overwhelming.So the main principle of the approach I stick to is to spend the least amount of time possible deciding what to store and where.The goal is to offload it at a later,presumably more convenient time.
Consequently,I gotta have a very clear,effortless,and repeatable way to populate my tool of choice and store the content.
By following ITIL and ITSM principles,I’ve got to streamline and operationalize my daily routines through a single point of entry.This will allow me to become almost automatic at certain activities to avoid spending hours for nothing.
There are several ways to do this,and one of them is absolutely incorrect :)
Wrong way:create a folder structure in your Notes app and try to create notes right in the corresponding folders during the day.For example,you have one folder for travel stuff,one for interesting articles,and another for legal documents.During the day,when you come across travel-related info,you put it directly into the Travel folder;Legal docs go to the Legal folder immediately,etc.This is wrong!
Possible way:create an Inbox folder in your Notes and put all the incoming information into it as separate notes during the day.Sort notes later into appropriate folders.Good,possible,but we can do better.
Best way:create a new Daily Note every day and populate it with content throughout the day using Apple’s Quick Note functionality.Sort it out during the evening routine(covered later in this article).
Why #3 is the best one?
First and foremost,it allows me to defer thinking,deciding,and sorting the information for later.
The routine of populating content is repeatable and unified across all Apple devices.You have Quick Note functionality,that behaves in the same way and is equally accessible on iPhones,iPads,and Macs.As a result,you get closer to automating your routine actions and spend no time remembering how exactly to do this.
Brand new Daily Note created every day is a canvas for all my thoughts and ideas throughout the day.It helps to avoid cluttering,which would have taken place if I had one single place or note open for eternity(like the way #2 above suggests).
Previous point also unveils one interesting fact—by starting your day with Daily Note you basically start from scratch,no backlog is transferred.By this move alone you filter out a lot of irrelevant stuff from the previous day.
I strongly recommend going with Daily Notes because of its advantages.It will save you a lot of time and stress daily.It will make it super easy to juggle various types of information coming at you during the day while being very flexible to have some chronological aspects covered as well.
A lot of my Daily Notes content is populated automatically via the Apple Shortcuts.Every morning special automation that I have created scans my calendar events and open tasks and neatly reflects them in my Daily Note for today.I’ll cover this automation in a separate article.
This is just an example—in the real world you may also want to have your Daily Goals reflected here,errands,have separate section“insights”or“journalling”,etc,etc.But once this canvas is configured,it becomes a useful starting point to deal with whatever content possible throughout the day.
In this example under Notes for Today section,I put all my meeting notes,incoming files,actions,drafts,ideas,sketches,flows,and schemes during my day.Later in the evening,I follow a certain routine to get rid of the irrelevant content and sort the rest of the stuff where it’s supposed to be.
What I find really amazing about the Quick Notes is that they behave in a very special way and provide some unique functionality across Apple ecosystem.That other applications cannot match even theoretically.
For supported applications,as well as anywhere on the Web,you may add links to corresponding pages or even application screens right in this popup Quick Note window.And what happens next is that this little quick note window will popup every time you visit this place next time.
This is especially useful for Daily Notes,because if you go this way,Daily Note will be the only popup window ready to receive your any input during the whole day,allowing you to streamline your content population process.
2 Ways to create Daily Notes in Apple Notes
Manual Way:
Create a folder Daily Notes,where you will store all your Daily Notes.
Every morning create a note,title it with Today’s date.
Move this new note to the Quick Note section of Apple Notes.
Automated Way:
Create a folder Daily Notes,where you will store all your Daily Notes.
Create a Shortcut that will automatically create a daily note in 1 click.Optionally,on this step you can add any other useful information that you would like to see appended to the newly created note automatically(like weather,calendar,etc).
Automate this Routine via Automation.For example,I may want to run this shortcut every morning at 9 am.
Every morning I move newly created Daily Note to Quick Notes,to ensure it is available in one single click or swipe across my devices.
What else can you use Daily Notes for
One of the useful things about Daily Notes is that they stay there in the Daily Notes folder as historical reference points.And all of them are perfectly“searchable”.Whatever you have put there,will stay there and you will be able to find it.You can always“get back in time”and see what happened on some particular date.That said,the list of activities Daily Notes might be useful for is quite interesting:
Canvas for ideas,random notes,and pure creativity.
Daily Goals.
Insights.
Journalling.
Mood tracking.
Weather tracking.
Place for drafts.
Brainstorming.
A“Limbo”for items that are hard to categorize.
It doesn’t matter which application you are using—this routine is almost certainly possible to adopt and configure anywhere.Some applications like Craft or NotePlan already have this functionality built-in,and they provide it in a very thoughtful way.I highly recommend checking these apps out if you’d like to structure your flow based on the Daily Notes extensively.

    Description = "When I was first diagnosed with HIV in 2002, I was lucky to gain access to a specialist who is a leader in HIV research and treatment in Canada. From my first set of tests, she assured me that I wouldn’t have to start any kind of treatment for another 10 years or so. So I never worried about myself then. All my focus was on my partner Jeff, as his tests showed he needed to start treatment soon. Even after he died, my own status wasn’t quite real to me. I was asymptomatic and the tests I submitted every six months continued to show I was healthy and the virus hadn’t yet affected me. So I was not prepared when only three years after her promise, my specialist said I’d have to start treatment. While still in the examining room, I took in the information she gave me about the drugs we would start with and their possible side effects. After our conversation, I went to the area with the nurses to submit another blood test. It was there that the news finally sunk in and I burst into tears. For the first time, the disease was real. I felt I had HIV in big letters stamped on my forehead. I already felt not normal, because I had lost Jeff to suicide. Now with HIV, I was for sure damaged goods; no one would ever want me. I’m currently on what my doctor calls the gold standard of HIV treatment, taking only one pill a day with no side effects. Even though my doctor told me all about the possible side effects, nothing could have prepared me for experiencing them. With just the first dose, I felt dizzy, clammy and not at all like myself. After the next day’s dose, I was even sicker. Almost as bad, it gave me really weird dreams. They were not scary per se — but were so vivid and intense that I would wake up panting and sweating, not able to discern whether I was still dreaming or awake. The dreams were also completely abstract — it felt like I was in a Salvador Dali painting. Nothing in the dreams resembled anything in real life… I remembered just intense colours, shapes and feelings that made no sense. The worst part was, I was not sick to begin with. But here I was, forcing horse pills down my throat, knowing that they would only continue to make me sick. In desperation, I remember after like the third day, I called the clinic’s nurse, crying, “I can’t take these side effects. I’m so sick… I don’t want to take these pills!” “I know,” she said. “But you just have to work through it.” I didn’t have a choice, so I “worked through it,” whatever that meant. I never felt more alone in my life. It was just before Christmas and everyone was busy with their own lives. There weren’t a lot of people I could call anyway — only a handful of friends knew my HIV status. Staying in bed was all I could do. I felt incredibly dizzy and weak. I had no appetite. If I didn’t have my dog, I wouldn’t have left my place at all. The worst was over after two weeks. But even after that, I would still get those weird dreams and I couldn’t stay up any later after I took the medication before bedtime, or else I would just feel nauseated. Over the years, we changed my regimen as new medications became available. I remember I used to take up to five pills, some more than once a day. I’m currently on what my doctor calls the gold standard of HIV treatment, taking only one pill a day with no side effects. I remain “undetectable,” which means that the amount of virus in my blood now was so low, the blood test can’t detect it, nor can I transmit the virus. Throughout all of this, I struggled to tell my friends about it. It was like coming out a second time because there is still so much stigma attached to HIV. And because I was super-sensitive to the moral and legal issues around HIV disclosure, I felt it was my duty to disclose in certain situations. Like the time I went to get a tattoo. Even though the industry had long been taking precautions, the artist I approached — at a very well-known studio in Toronto — declined to do the work because of my status. I also felt it was necessary to inform guys I was dating of my status. Sometimes, I did it even before I met them in person as I was using online dating sites then. I remember one particular guy who messaged me — I had recognized him from around the village but was too nervous to ever talk to him because I thought he was so handsome. Like an idiot, I disclosed right away as we chatted online … and he just disappeared. Poof! I resolved that I wouldn’t tell anyone until I felt they really needed to know. And even when I told myself that I deserved more than guys who would reject me based on my status, it was still rejection. And it hurt. Not all reacted negatively. There were, of course, guys who didn’t go running away, including my now-husband Kenneth. Over the years, I felt less self-conscious about it. And while I didn’t exactly broadcast it, there were occasions when I was okay to talk about it with people. A few years ago, I shared my status on social media. But then I changed jobs, and I didn’t feel my new workplace would be a great place to be “out,” so I restricted the posts to private or to a select few. The gay community still grapples with HIV stigma, which is unfortunate, because not only does it affect people living with HIV, but it also has a negative impact on the fight against the disease. It was not uncommon once for personal ads and profiles to say, “drug and disease free.” Even now, some guys will still use the word “clean,” as code for being HIV-negative. There is one silver lining to my HIV status, though — I have been able to access mental health services for people living with HIV specifically. That’s because research shows a direct correlation between HIV and mental illness. My care providers always take into account the effects of HIV as part of my mental health treatment. For example, apathy is common for people living with HIV, and fighting to stay motivated remains the most challenging part of my depression to this day. It’s taken me a long time to get to this point… to be able to talk about these emotional and traumatic events and to move forward. There were times I didn’t want to move forward. I didn’t want to be anywhere but in my bed. And there were times when I just wanted the pain to stop. I am lucky to have Kenneth in my life. It has not been easy for him, when oftentimes, he has to take up the slack when I am unable get out of bed. I believe the worst is behind me, although the effects of depression still linger. It’s taken me years to find some peace with my diagnosis — to see myself not as damaged, but as someone who’s endured. The disease doesn’t impact me at all day-to-day, except for when I have to take my pill at night. Sometimes, I don’t think about it at all; other times, it reminds me that I am “different,” and that can be exhausting. I still have work to do, but I am more open with my story. It’s mine, and I’m finally learning to live it fully. Editor’s note: People living with HIV can almost always be treated effectively, and unless they lose access to treatment or frequently stop and restart treatment, HIV will almost always be undetectable in their blood, they will be unable to infect others through sex, and their lifespan will equal or exceed that of members of the general public. Mothers with HIV do not pass the virus on in childbirth if they are in effective treatment, and they are encouraged to breastfeed. If you believe you have been exposed to HIV, then getting tested is the best way to prevent future health problems and to help stop the virus from infecting others. Ask your doctor or call an HIV hotline to learn about the best window for testing and to learn how to be tested for free.",

    Description = "Chances are that many of us will never know that we are the bully in someone else’s story. When our world feels uncertain, dominating or dismissing others offers a counterfeit sense of control and escape from our own pain. Bullying, verbal or physical, is one of the behaviors that provides this temporary relief. Control in place of uncertainty, superiority in place of anxiety, and power in place of pain can be attractive as a misguided form of emotional regulation. It seems easier than extending kindness. But the more one depends on domination for validation, the more fragile that validation becomes. As we discuss below, the neuroscience of bullying shows that empathy networks weaken, and dominance pathways strengthen — reinforcing the cycle of control and emptiness. This is as true on playgrounds and in workplaces as it is in politics. In each of these situations, there is a common theme: a person or group using bullying to fill a void or ease a pain. Yet, ironically, in the process, they dig a deeper hole. A bully stacks others’ confidence beneath his feet like boxes to stand taller. But eventually the boxes topple. Over the last month, UNESCO held Global Day Against Violence and Bullying in Schools; some countries held events around last week’s Anti-Bullying Awareness Week. Its motto this year is “Power for Good.” From Brother to Bully A dense, chaotic crowd of cartoon-like faces fills the frame, drawn in vivid colors — magenta, orange, purple, and ochre. Each face bears exaggerated eyes and wide, uneven grins that seem both anxious and aggressive. Some expressions look frightened, others mocking or domineering. The overlapping figures blur the line between victim and bully, capturing the confusion, conformity, and tension within group cruelty. Artwork by © Francois Top. [From ChatGPT] Bullies and Brothers (illustration by Francois Top) Surprisingly, the etymology of the word ‘bully’ once meant ‘brother’ or ‘sweetheart.’ In sixteenth-century Dutch, boel referred to a beloved companion, the person you know who stands by you when others turn away. Over time, affection curdled into aggression. Our hope with this piece is to offer context for why, despite our best intentions, we do not always use our power for good. Understanding the forces that distort our empathy and turn insecurity into domination is the first step toward reclaiming power as a force for care rather than control. The challenge, then, is whether we can become again a band of brothers rather than a band of bullies. The Neuroscience of Bullying Neuroscience offers unsettling insights into why we resort to or can be tempted to engage in bullying behavior. Acts of domination activate the brain’s reward circuitry — the same network stimulated by gambling, risk-taking, and addictive substances. Each act triggers a brief surge of dopamine and adrenaline, providing temporary relief from anxiety or inadequacy. Over time, the brain learns cruelty as a habit, and control becomes the language of, or a substitute for, connection. Bullying often begins in the silent corridors of our personal insecurity. It is an effort to fill an internal void that cannot really be filled by anything else. Dr. Kristin Neff’s work on self-compassion helps us see that the first bully we ever meet is the one inside our own head. As a recent piece by Morra Aaron-Meles recently noted, Neff’s “inner critic” activates the same fight-or-flight pathways that external threats do. Some of us turn the fight response inward through harsh self-criticism; others turn it outward through defensiveness, blame, or domination (For more on the shame compass, see our post here). A schematic diagram titled Compass of Shame Defenses shows a red compass with four arrows pointing in opposite directions. The upward arrow represents Withdrawal, the downward arrow Avoidance, the right arrow Attack Self, and the left arrow Attack Other. Together they illustrate four common behavioral responses to shame. (Adapted from Nathanson, D. (1992). Shame and Pride: Affect, Sex, and the Birth of the Self. New York: Norton.) [From ChatGPT] Source: Nathanson D (1992) Shame and pride: Affect, sex, and the birth of the self. New York: Norton.) To make their task easier, bullies become pretty skilled at spotting vulnerability — the hesitant tone, the uncertain gaze, the subtle signs of self-doubt that mirror their own. The aggression that follows is projection, an attack on what they most fear within themselves. Online and in politics, we do not even need to spot vulnerability because we can just dismiss and attack entire groups. When we do it in groups within our social and political echo chambers, we do not just enhance our tribal allegiance; we are fueled and protected by it. For the bullied, being mocked or excluded activates the same brain regions as a bodily injury. Prolonged exposure floods the system with cortisol, negatively impacting concentration, memory, and sleep. The nervous system remains on chronic high alert. Those who are bullied often internalize the aggression as truth. Every insult, exclusion, or public humiliation deepens the illusion that they are somehow less. They begin to shrink, speak less, and question their own worth. What makes bullying uniquely cruel is this inversion. The powerful one feels small and hides it through cruelty; the smaller one is made to feel invisible and believes it. Both are caught in the same tragic loop of fear and validation: both experience biological change — one desensitized to harm, the other hyper-attuned to it. The one with the ego loses as much as the one whose ego has been crushed. Both find themselves defeated. Beyond the Playground The scientific study of bullying began more than a century ago. In 1897, psychologist Edmund C. Burk published “Teasing and Bullying” in The Pedagogical Seminary, the first systematic description of aggressive behavior among schoolchildren. What Burk observed on playgrounds now infects offices, institutions, and digital spaces. Bullying is not a mere disagreement, nor is it the friction that accompanies ordinary differences. It is a pattern of behavior marked by repetition, intention, and an imbalance of power. It involves one party exerting control, be it social, professional, or emotional, over another who cannot easily defend themselves. This has profound societal and organizational implications, affecting not just the individuals involved but also the culture and productivity of the groups they belong to. Public displays of aggression stimulate sensations of power for both the speaker and their supporters, and that reinforcement increases the likelihood of repetition, normalizing intimidation as a political instrument. It happens in classrooms, offices, dinner parties, and WhatsApp groups. In Germany, the word mobbing captures the collective nature of such behavior and aggression as a group activity, the intersection of conformity and cowardice. What follows can be “normative drift” — the slow corrosion of empathy when cruelty becomes expected. Institutions adapt, individuals adjust, and soon even well-meaning people participate in emotional or social exclusion because it is easy, expedient, and increasingly technologically enabled. Cyberbullying has extended these dynamics online. Cruelty becomes easier when we do not have to look the other person in the eye, so over time, we become desensitized to what is happening to them. According to UNESCO, 58% of girls and young women experience online harassment, and minority or migrant learners face disproportionate exclusion. Professional, Political, and Personal In professional settings, bullying can involve belittling and unreasonable demands but can also hide behind a mask of legitimacy, ranging from chronic exclusion from meetings or deliberate withholding of information. Global surveys reveal its reach. For instance, an Indian workplace survey reported 55% of Indian employees have been bullied at work, while the latest US survey shows 32% adult Americans being bullied. Digital workspaces have become the new schoolyard. Group chats, message threads, and email loops can become subtle weapons of social control. Exclusion, ridicule, or passive resistance are now transmitted through emojis, silence, or selective omission. In an era of remote work, bullying takes new forms, perhaps passive-aggressive messaging. These same dynamics now shape civic life. In politics, bullying becomes both method and message: verbal aggression, humiliation, and public shaming directed at opponents, journalists, civil servants, or people who do not adhere to the dominant orthodoxy of a particular place. The purpose is not persuasion but submission. Politicians used to have “opponents” — now we feel that people with different political and religious views as our opponents. Most of the time, we and they are being manipulated by those who understand the game of power imbalance and fear. In all these domains — professional, political, and personal — the pattern remains constant: insecurity disguised as authority, domination masquerading as control. The casualties are empathy and democracy. Breaking the Cycle Breaking the cycle, or at least reducing its velocity, requires clear definitions, organizational action, and personal resistance. Understand Phenomena Bullying and harassment often coexist but are not synonymous. Some nations treat both under one law, while others, like the U.S. and India, do not. Bullying is a behavioral issue; harassment is a legal one. The latter involves unwanted actions related to protected characteristics such as race, sex, religion, or national origin — conduct that creates a hostile or degrading environment. Under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, harassment becomes actionable when it undermines dignity or disrupts a person’s ability to work. In contrast, bullying may not meet the legal threshold but can still cause deep psychological harm. It must be repeated and sustained often for weeks, months, and even years. Managerial Action From an organizational perspective, the distinction is less about how harm occurs than about how accountability is enforced. Great managers understand that conflict, when handled constructively, can fuel innovation — but when disagreements become personal and persistent, they evolve into bullying. Recognizing this distinction allows us to balance performance management with vigilance against genuine abuse. For managers, this means modeling respect and making it safe to speak up, your tone sets the cultural standard. Once incidents or patterns become clear, it is best to act early and intervene before conflict escalates, listen without rushing to judgment, and document behavior in a way that protects everyone. This requires objectivity that comes from self-awareness. How bullying might have looked or felt to us is not relevant to the situation at hand. It is important to remember that bullying is not always top-down. Managers, too, can be targeted — excluded, undermined, or embarrassed by peers or subordinates. Power dynamics shift in all directions. The central issue is not hierarchy but vulnerability. Personal Resistance Bullying can be escaped, endured, and ultimately transformed. “Above all, keep perspective: bullying often stems from insecurity, not superiority, and recognizing that helps you detach your self-worth from their behavior,” advises Assistant Professor Shreya Mishra, an expert in the field. “However, in some instances, self-preservation is not weakness, and knowing when to walk away shows more strength than we give it credit for.” Family obligations, visa status, financial pressures, or professional passion anchor people in difficult workplaces. The goal shifts to strategic endurance: visualize the next few weeks or months and plan how you will build yourself — emotionally, professionally, and reputationally. Strengthen your internal market value by skilling up; the more competent and indispensable you become, the less sway a bully has over you. In a qualitative study in India, Shreya Mishra, Manosi Chaudhuri, and Ajoy Dey (2021) found that those who effectively confronted workplace bullying did so by strengthening their personal identity. Mishra reminds us that “because power is not static, if today it is with the bully, tomorrow it will be with you. Resisting lies means reclaiming — and maybe reforming — your identity. The very identity that the bully aims to destroy.” Indeed, bullies often attack identities, not tasks — the qualities that make someone visible, valued, or distinct. This is when personal identity work becomes a form of defiance. For every narrative your bully creates (“You don’t fit in”), you consider a counter-narrative for yourself (“I have earned my place” or “I contribute meaningfully”). Engaging in these behaviors can help individuals “deflate” this imbalance by enhancing their personal identities by consciously reconnecting with their sense of purpose, competence, and worth. Political Conversations Just as these individual strategies can help rebalance power within workplaces, so too does democracy depend on balance — between freedom and responsibility, conviction and humility, self-expression and restraint. Deepening polarization over the past decade has led to profound concern across many countries. Emotional distress, collective unease, greater distrust, or the psychological exhaustion many feel might have led voters to seek relief in tribal certainty or anger. When we feel chronically anxious, unheard, or powerless, we are more likely to engage in extreme thinking. We turn the complex into conflict so we do not have to engage with very complicated issues. Polarization and branding those who oppose us as heretics becomes a kind of emotional anesthesia. Research in psychology and psychiatry helps explain this. Studies from the American Psychological Association (APA, 2023) (aptly entitled Stress in America: The Stress in our Nation) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, 2024) show that sustained stress and anxiety increase the brain’s need for cognitive closure. Under pressure, as we wrote earlier, the amygdala under threat fires rapidly, and our precious prefrontal cortex loses out. We retreat into rigid thinking not because we are evil, but out of fear and political identity provides a tribe, a story, and the illusion of control — and occasionally, the promise of a savior who turns out to be merely human. Neuroscientific studies published in Nature Human Behaviour (2022) and The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (2023) show that exposure to uncertainty or perceived threat increases both partisan bias and moral disengagement. The physiological reward of outrage — accelerated heart rate, adrenaline, and dopamine release — mimics the gratification of addictive behavior. And the social media and tech moguls are eager to cater and foster those behaviors with “intermittent reinforcement,” like the ones from gambling or risk-taking. And chronic exposure to hostility, personal or political, prolongs physiological stress responses linked to depression, hypertension, and insomnia. It is literally a vicious circle. In this domain too, we can work on redressing the imbalance: - Verify information before sharing it, read beyond the headline, and refuse to forward contempt. - Try to speak directly with those who disagree with you before you speak about them. - Support local journalism and libraries, for they preserve the common record when parties try to expunge it - Attend one community meeting more than you really want to (or just one!), and vote in every election, even the minor ones. - End the exchange or ask for evidence when political conversation turns cruel and ad hominem; do not reward aggression with attention. The main thing is to remember that in public life, as at work, bullies depend on reaction to confirm power. Denying that reaction is sometimes the most effective form of resistance. The Cost of Control What if, in our search for certainty, we have all become versions of the same bullies we fear? Democracies, like workplaces, fail when dominance replaces dialogue. Before the next meeting, the next post, the next vote, it is worth asking: am I engaging to learn, support, and solve or prevail, punish, and dominate? If we view bullying not simply as deviant behavior but as the meeting of two wounded lives, the healing potential appears. Those who feel diminished must remember that their worth is intact; those who inflict pain should pause and recognize that fear, not power, drives their actions. Power gained through fear is an illusion — a mask worn by those afraid to be seen as they are. When we confront the void within ourselves, the insecurity, the longing, the need for control, we can begin to dismantle the illusions that sustain cruelty. Only then can we replace domination with empathy and silence with understanding. That works starts with us. Do What a (Special) Eight-Year-Old Would Another step is to take inspiration from leaders like Danica Purg, the founder, former Dean and now President of IEDC, a business school that embraces ethics, sustainability, and the arts since its inception. Last week, she was inducted into the prestigious management Thinkers50 Hall of Fame. Watching her get this award was very moving because when I first met her, she had told me a defining story. When her little classmate was being bullied, and adults stood by, then 8-year-old Danica organized the kids in her class to march out and get support from another school for justice. They did. A few years later, she started a business school by a Slovenian lake to train leaders who do better. To use power for good is not an abstract ideal for her. In the end, every society and group must decide whether it wishes to operate as and support bands of brothers or tolerate and fuel bands of bullies. The measure of leadership and humanity in classes, homes, workplaces, communities, and countries is not how much control we can exert. It is about: how much courage we show when others need protection; the discipline to think about how and why they might need such care; and, the humility and hard work to consider to whom we owe an apology we never realized was due. Another Thinkers50 awardee, Professor Ranjay Gulati, offers tools in a recent Harvard Business Review piece on how to be bold for good.

    Description = "At some point between 100,000 years ago and for as long as there have been anatomically modern humans, man began using language to interpret his own actions. To socialize. To create.\n\nAnimals communicate, but they do not express themselves. Their languages, though meaningful at times, are closed systems: their cries, gestures, expressions, warnings — all necessarily identical to their functions.\n\nHuman language, of course, departs from this simplicity. It is recursive, self-referential, and painfully excessive. It preserves life, but also ultimately defines it, suturing the raw distance between thought and thing.\n\nEven so, your language doesn’t indicate your humanity.\n\nOne’s language does not represent human essence, but instead discloses that no essence whatsoever can be truly preserved.\n\nIn the very instant consciousness seeks to represent itself through speech, it has separated itself from the form it sought to portray. We do not possess language so much as we are intrinsically possessed by it, compelled to translate that which simply cannot be perfectly translated.\n\nFor instance, no one can perfectly describe an apple, but the simplest and most accurate description of it — the word apple — alludes to its general form.\n\nBut if I asked you to imagine a bowl of rosy red apples, you would conjure up your own. Perhaps yours are shiny; perhaps they are dull, bruised, softened by time; perhaps they sit in a wooden bowl; perhaps it is ceramic. What you picture is not what I intend, yet it is enough for you to believe you have understood me.\n\nThus, our language is a bridge constructed between imaginations that can never truly meet.\n\nAnd so, this distortion between us becomes the birthplace of all art, music, religion, philosophy, and myth — all attempts to identify the feelings that language itself falls short of wholly articulating.\n\nThe greatest writers and orators who inspire the most emotion, who convey the best stories, who are considered great within their craft, are simply the ones who convey the raw, unfiltered, ineffably abstract form of the human’s creative soul the most effectively.\n\nIt is tempting to assume the belief that language itself proves our rationality — that because we speak, because we write, we must therefore think. This syllogism is untrue.\n\nLanguage itself is the residue of thought.\n\nIt is complex, yet also a structurally constrained manifestation of something prior and far more abstract than it: the human capacity to reason, to distinguish, to imagine what has not yet been realized.\n\nSpeech itself does not separate us from animals; the implicit fact that our speech hosts noncurrent reflection does.\n\nHuman language is, of course, distinct from animal communication, but this suggests very little, if not nothing, about what it means to be human, as by reducing the human to his language is to mistake the expression of reason for reason itself.\n\nWords are simply the architecture through which our already very substantial intentions are made communicable. This distinction, however, has never mattered more than now, as we’ve entered an age where machines can produce human-identical language without ever once intending it.\n\nIt is hard to argue that artificial intelligence hasn’t mastered the simulation of speech, yet it remains — even if its products suggest otherwise — absolutely untouched by the conditions that would give its emulations any degree of meaning.\n\nWhat artificial intelligence producing ‘meaningful’ language implies isn’t that the machine itself is intelligent, but that our own assumptions about ‘meaning’ are fragile and misinterpreted. If meaning through language can come into meaning without a consciousness, then language was never a measure of humanity so much as it was merely an inadequate reflection of it.\n\nIn outsourcing creation to machines, we inherently forget that the prerequisite of creativity itself is that of drawing ever onward by the unattainable ideal of perfect expression.\n\nThus, the danger of non-humans producing human-like language isn’t that machines think as we do, but rather that we may forget, as humans, that thinking is a costly action. Speaking meaningfully must necessarily involve exposing oneself to misunderstanding, but, moreover, trying to understand and articulate that understanding; to create is risking inadequacy, but the act of creating should necessarily involve communicating abstract ideas and feelings, all the while practicing adequacy.\n\nThe pulse of human creativity is the will to shape that which is perpetually unshapeable.\n\nThis, perhaps, is both the tragedy and triumph of what it means to be human: that we are condemned to pursue that can never be perfectly articulated, and yet redeemed by the pursuit itself.\n\nArtificial intelligence, growing in proficiency as it is, will refine the creation of language, but will never struggle to do so.\n\nAI produces language without consciousness, while animals possess consciousness (however limited) without language. In this sense, artificial intelligence is more animalistic than even the meagerest of animals — not because it lacks rationality, but because nothing in it strains. It knows no resistance, no inward friction. It does not know the cost of articulation. It is coded to consider itself perpetually correct.\n\nFor AI, our world is endlessly sterile. Everything is apparent and nothing is inexpressible, as AI doesn’t have the faculties to imagine abstractions (nor any imaginatory faculties to begin with).\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is the difference between humans and AI.\n\nWhat remains — and must remain — ours, then, is the narrow space in our minds that we’ve designated as being for imagination. To be human is not to perfect expression of our thoughts, but to reach towards the thoughts themselves, wrestling endlessly with them, sharing them to others using the tool that is our language, and rejoicing, not for perfection, but the sisyphean goal of achieving it.",

    Description = "Human engineering isn’t what you might think. It’s not a eugenic nightmare of bioengineering and gene selection. Thank goodness, it’s much more benign. Instead, human engineering is a multi-disciplinary field that brings together psychologists, engineers, cognitive scientists, organizational behavioral specialists, and designers. Their goal is to make it easy for people to do the right thing. Sometimes referred to as interaction design or cognitive ergonomics, the aim of human engineering is to improve human performance by looking at systems.\n\nSimply put, human engineering tries to make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing for any task or activity. This aim is achieved through the design (and alteration of existing designs) of the technology, systems, and environments that individuals interact with. Immediately we see the application of human engineering into the paradigm of system dynamics and human error.\n\nThere are many principles of human engineering, but one of the most important is the importance of designing the interactions of humans and objects to align function with action. To demonstrate, consider the very common scenario of turning on a burner on the kitchen stove.\n\nThe Mysterious Case of the Wrong Burner\n\nHas it ever happened that you’ve gone to turn on the stove and lit the wrong burner? It’s not just you. It’s a very common problem and one of the most studied topics in the field of human engineering. Stoves are not advanced technology and lighting the stove only requires one turn of the knob. So how come we’re so prone to these simple mistakes?\n\nThe answer has to do with the way the alignment of form and function. Stovetops are tremendously bad at this alignment. Consider two popular configurations of commercial stoves: Two stovetop configurations. One with knobs grouped, the other with them evenly spaced and linear.\nSource: Design of Everyday Things\n\nIn typical stove designs (let’s call them Configuration A and Configuration B), we see that the burners are aligned as a 2x2 rectangle, whereas the knobs are aligned linearly along the front. The knobs and the burners are configured differently. To use a technical term, we could say that these configurations have poor spatial compatibility.\n\nConfiguration B is slightly better than Configuration A, because there is a natural grouping between the two burners and knobs on the left and the two burners and knobs on the right. Nevertheless, in this configuration errors will be common and proper use will rely on reading the labels on the knobs or trial and error. In short, it takes some level of cognitive effort, beyond intuition to ensure consistent proper use of the stove.\n\nThe Better Way\n\nNow consider two slightly different configurations. In Configuration C the burners are still arranged in a 2x2 rectangle, but now, the knobs are also arranged in a similar way. There is a natural alignment between the controls and the device. No labels are needed.\nTwo (different) stovetop configurations. One forming a diamond the other an arch shape\nSource: Design of Everyday Things\n\nConfiguration D provides another natural and intuitive layout, but this time maintains the linear arrangement of the knobs. Simply by bringing the two back burners closer together to align with the knobs, the stovetop has gone from an inscrutable, error-prone appliance to something that is intuitive and easy to use.\n\nWithout objection, we can see why the stovetop configurations in Configuration C and Configuration D are better. Not only will these configurations produce fewer errors and lead to more consistent and effective operation of the stove but they also rely on intuition and require less cognitive processing to achieve the greater result! A win-win!\n\nOh by the way, how much did the change cost? We used the same space, the same controls, and the same materials. We can decrease errors, build resiliency, and decrease the cognitive load without sizable investments! Win-Win-Win!\n\nThe Principle of Spatial Compatibility\n\nWhat we’ve just witnessed is the principle of spatial compatibility in action. This principle states that controls should be arranged to correspond naturally with the devices they control. When there’s a clear, intuitive mapping between control and function, people simply know what to do. No thinking required. No labels needed. No errors made.\n\nThis might seem obvious when pointed out, but look around your environment. How many poorly designed interfaces do you interact with daily? How many times do you have to stop and think about which button does what? How often do you make “simple mistakes” that are actually design failures?\n\nThe stove example illustrates a profound truth: most of what we attribute to human error is actually design error. We blame ourselves for our mistakes when we should be blaming the systems we’re forced to work within.\n\nWhen Design Betrays You\n\nStovetops are not the only place where we encounter human engineering in our daily lives. Even something as simple as a door can pose significant challenges to human-technology interaction (Yes, a door is technology). We’ve all been in that embarrassing situation where we push a door that should’ve been pulled and vice versa. But have you ever stopped to ask why you made an error? Take solace in knowing that it was the door’s fault and not your own.\n\nThese doors did you wrong. They betrayed you. They gave a signal that was incorrect, and your only fault was that you trusted them. Who knew that doors could be so deceitful? Take heart, this is a very common problem. One person who this has happened to a lot is Don Norman. Don knows a lot about these sorts of doors. Don has studied these doors so much that these species of doors are actually called “Norman Doors.”\n\nIn his book “The Design of Everyday Things” he explains: “How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it…The design of the door should indicate how to work it without the needs of signs or trial and error.”\n\nThe Principle of Discoverability\n\nThe chief way these doors betray the user is by abandoning another fundamental and important design principle, the principle of discoverability. The principle of discoverability simply states that any designed object should make it clear to the user how to correctly use that object. In the case of the Norman door, not only did the door make it unclear, but it probably sent the exact opposite signal than what was required.\n\nConsider a door with a horizontal push bar on it. That bar screams “PUSH ME!” to anyone who sees it. It’s a clear affordance — a visual cue about how the object should be used. Now imagine that same door with a “PULL” sign on it. The sign contradicts everything the door is telling you with its design. The horizontal bar is still there, still suggesting you should push, but now you’re supposed to ignore that signal and pull instead.\n\nThis is fundamentally bad design. A well-designed pull door should have a vertical handle that you can grip. A well-designed push door should have a flat plate or push bar. The design itself should communicate the proper use without requiring any labels or explanations.\n\nWhy This Matters More Than You Think\n\nThe Norman door is an important example of human engineering in daily life because it showcases how the alignment of human action and the environment impacts our propensity to make mistakes. If something as simple, ordinary, and untechnical as a door can impact the decisions, efficiency, and productivity of individuals than how much more will this be true for complex systems.\n\nIndeed, the inefficiencies of these everyday objects may seem trivial and insignificant but the underlying principles they demonstrate are anything but, especially when applied to industry. What these vignettes demonstrate is important and powerful. Using the same space and the same equipment for the stove, we nearly eliminated the possibility for error. No rework, no guess and check, no errors, no need for labels, less thinking, no need to stop and think about the result of our actions and all for no money.\n\nHuman engineering is potent and powerful.\n\nThe Core Principles of Human Engineering\n\nWhile there are many principles of human engineering, several stand out as particularly important for designing better systems: 1. Spatial Compatibility: Controls should be arranged to naturally correspond with the things they control. The layout should be intuitive and obvious. 2. Discoverability: The design should clearly communicate how something is meant to be used. Users shouldn’t have to guess or rely on labels and instructions. 3. Feedback: The system should provide clear, immediate feedback about what’s happening. When you press a button, something should happen that confirms your action was received. 4. Constraints: Good design constrains behavior in ways that prevent errors. If something can only be done one way, and that way is the correct way, errors become impossible. 5. Mapping: There should be a clear relationship between controls and their effects. Natural mappings leverage existing knowledge and expectations. 6. Affordances: The design should suggest its own use. A handle affords pulling. A button affords pressing. A flat surface affords pushing.\n\nThe Human-Centered Design Philosophy\n\nAt its core, human engineering embodies a fundamental philosophy: when a person makes an error while using a system, it’s the system that failed, not the person. This perspective shift is revolutionary. Instead of training people harder, writing more procedures, or adding more warnings, we redesign the system so that errors become difficult or impossible to make.\n\nThis doesn’t mean humans are absolved of all responsibility. It means we recognize the reality of human limitations and capabilities, and we design accordingly. We accept that people will be distracted, tired, stressed, and forgetful. We acknowledge that people will sometimes be in a hurry, sometimes be interrupted, sometimes misremember.\n\nRather than fighting against human nature, human engineering works with it. Rather than demanding superhuman perfection, it creates systems where ordinary human performance is sufficient for excellent results.\n\nThe Cognitive Load Consideration\n\nOne of the most important benefits of good human engineering is the reduction of cognitive load. Every poorly designed interface, every ambiguous control, every unclear instruction adds to the mental burden people must carry. When you have to stop and think about which burner is which, or whether to push or pull a door, you’re using cognitive resources that could be applied elsewhere.\n\nGood design frees up mental capacity. It allows you to focus on what matters rather than wrestling with interfaces. It reduces decision fatigue. It makes the right choice the obvious choice, the easy choice, the path of least resistance.\n\nThink about how exhausting it is to navigate a poorly designed website, a confusing form, or a cluttered workspace. Now think about how effortless it is to use a well-designed tool. That difference, that feeling of friction versus flow, is human engineering in action.\n\nApplication Beyond Physical Objects\n\nWhile we’ve focused on physical examples like stoves and doors, human engineering principles apply to every system you interact with: - Digital interfaces: Are your most-used apps and tools intuitive, or do they require constant mental translation? - Work processes: Do your workflows naturally guide you toward the right actions, or do they create opportunities for confusion? - Personal routines: Are your habits supported by environmental design, or do they require constant willpower to maintain? - Communication systems: Do your methods of staying informed and responsive flow naturally, or do they create constant friction?\n\nIn each of these domains, the principles remain the same. Make the right thing easy. Make the wrong thing hard. Provide clear feedback. Create natural mappings. Reduce cognitive load.\n\nThe Power of Environmental Design\n\nHuman engineering reminds us that we don’t need to become better people to perform better. We need to create better systems. We don’t need more discipline, more willpower, more training. We need environments that support us rather than fight us.\n\nThis is liberating. It means improvement doesn’t require becoming someone you’re not. It requires thoughtfully designing the systems and environments you operate within. It means recognizing that when you consistently make the same “mistake,” it’s probably not your fault — it’s a design failure waiting to be fixed.\n\nThe question isn’t “How can I be more careful?” The question is “How can I redesign this system so being careful isn’t necessary?”\n\nThat’s the promise and power of human engineering.",

    Description = "In the summer of 2019, my wife and I took our two sons for a hike in the Lost Pines Forest in Bastrop, Texas.\n\nIt was a Saturday or a Sunday.\n\nI had a bunch of articles to write, but I put it aside and decided to spend some time outside with the kids in the shade of the prehistoric loblolly forest about thirty minutes from our house.\n\nIt was a lovely afternoon, despite the heat. I always love Lost Pines because it’s a freak of nature. The tall prehistoric loblolly pine trees appear here in the middle of Texas, hundreds of miles further east than most of their counterparts. Much of the forest still shows scars from two 2011 wildfires that burned tens of thousands of acres — one of them the worst in Texas history — only adding to the mystique and making parts feel like a haunted elephant graveyard.\n\nAs we wrapped up the hike and took the kids to the playground, suddenly, it hit me. It was a feeling that creative people experience from time to time. You’re in the middle of not working–you’re in the shower or your drifting off to sleep or you’re in the middle of sweeping the floor–and boom, you get hit with an idea. I have run many hundreds of miles in Lost Pines so it was a familiar feeling — I’ve sold business problems and writing problems and personal problems on the trails there.\n\nAs I was carrying my son in the backpack, my mind had drifted briefly to the fact that my book Stillness is the Key would soon be released and it would mark the end of what had become a three-book trilogy. What would I tackle next?, I thought. This was 2019. The political situation was a mess. There were wildfires, earthquakes, wars dragging on, terrorist attacks. There was chaos, upheaval, and uncertainty. “A book about courage would be cool,” popped into my head. I shared the idea with my wife. We talked it over along the trail, and by the time we were loading the kids in the car, an idea for one book had become an idea for a series on the four virtues, starting with courage!\n\nAnd like that, my next creative mountain had been laid out in front of me.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this story lately because here I am, six years later, coming to the end of that series, as the fourth and final book, Wisdom Takes Work, came out last week.\n\nThere was a period a couple of years ago where I didn’t think I would be here having completed the series. It was around the halfway mark, working on the second book in the series, Discipline is Destiny, and I hit a wall.\n\nComing up with the idea for a book — or in this case, a series — is a fun, creative act. Actually creating those books is a work of excruciating manual labor, sitting in a chair, grinding out each consecutive sentence — a process not measured in hours or days, but months and years. It’s a marathon of endurance, cognitive and physical.\n\nFor me, in the last decade, I have run not just a couple of these marathons but twelve of them, back to back to back. That’s roughly 2.5 million words across titles I’ve published, articles I’ve written, and the daily emails that I produced in the same period.\n\nDuring that time, there was a destabilizing, devastating global pandemic. There were fires, floods, and freezes. Demagogues and wars. Market crashes and inflation. Technological disruption. My kids growing up. My wife and I opening and running a small town bookstore.\n\nSo I was tired. Just really tired.\n\nI’m not someone inclined to believe in divine intervention. But I needed help . . .\n\nOn a sweltering-hot day in Texas, I was sitting at my workroom table in my office above the bookstore. The air conditioner wasn’t working and I wasn’t sure if we could afford another one for the building. It was my 34th birthday. Sweating, exhausted, and on the verge of a crisis of confidence — that I had the wrong topic, I didn’t have the material, and contemplating whether to call my publisher and ask for a delay — I went through boxes that contained thousands of note cards of research. As a whole, they overwhelmed me — what they contained, the way they might fit together to produce a book, seemed impossible to comprehend. I reached out and grabbed one.\n\nIt had just two dozen words scrawled in red Sharpie. When was it written? Why had I written it? What had prompted me? All I know is what it said.\n\n    Trust the process. Keep doing my cards. When I check them in June — if I have done my work — there will be a book there.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly a miracle . . . but defying space and time, I had traveled from the past into the future to deliver a reminder of self-discipline.\n\nAnd guess what? It was exactly what I needed.\n\nIt didn’t save me from the work, of course, but from myself. From giving up. From abandoning the system and process that had served me so well on all those books and articles and emails. In one of the best passages in Meditations, Marcus Aurelius, almost certainly in the depths of some personal crisis of faith, reminds himself to “Love the discipline you know, and let it support you.”\n\nThat’s what my note said to do.\n\nI listened.\n\nI began showing up at the office earlier each day to work with my material. Card after card, I sorted them into tiny little piles. Looking for connections, for threads I could follow, for the key that would unlock the book.\n\nInstead of worrying, I used the calm and mild light of the philosophy I have written about in my books. I went for long walks when I got stuck. I tried to follow my routine. I tuned out distraction. I focused. I also sat — just sat — and thought.\n\nI’d love to be able to tell you that shortly after this the book just clicked. But that’s not how writing, or life, works. What actually happened was slower, more iterative, but also in the end, just as transformative.\n\nAs I walked that long hallway of doubt and despair, as I kept doing my cards, light began to creep in. Lou Gehrig and Angela Merkel stepped forward from the shadows. After nearly four thousand pages of biographies, Queen Elizabeth entered as a portrait of temperament. Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and King George IV jumped out as cautionary tales, stunning examples of self-inflicted destruction. One character after another slowly, painstakingly, chapter by chapter, became discernable.\n\nThe book was there, as my note promised me. Now I had to write it.\n\nWhile a book requires many, many hours of work, these hours come in rather small increments. If I get to the office at eight thirty, I could be done writing by eleven. Just a couple hours is all it takes. Just a couple crappy pages a day, as one old writing rule puts it. The discipline of writing is about showing up. No delays, no procrastination, no digital distractions. Just writing.\n\nThe seasons changed. World events raged and spun as they always do. Opportunities, distractions, temptations, they did what they do too — popping up, pinging, nagging, seducing.\n\nDay after day, I kept after it. I trusted the process. I loved the discipline I knew. I let it support me.\n\nAs I finished the book, I was still tired. Every writer is tired when they get to the end of a book. Yet, I also felt wonderful. I thought it was to date some of my best writing, but what I was proudest of is who I was while I wrote it. A less disciplined me, a younger me, would have been wrecked by that period where it felt like the book might not come together. I would have acted out. I would have been consumed. But the work had been working on me — as I worked from home on the final pages of Discipline, my five-year-old looked up from his art project and said, “I’m sorry you lost your job writing books, Dad.” Apparently things had been so much less crazy and my boundaries had been so much better that he thought I wasn’t working anymore!\n\nBut I was, of course. I was in the process. Doing my cards. Trusting the discipline I knew would lead to the next book, Right Thing Right Now, and the final one, Wisdom Takes Work.\n\nAs a result, here I am — having read over 500 books of research, made 10,000 note cards, published 300,000 words (with tens of thousands of additional words cut) and 1,400 pages — drawing the series to a close.\n\nWhen Edward Gibbon finished ​The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire​, he noted his sadness at taking “everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion.”\n\nI don’t feel that way, though, because of everything I learned during these past six years spent working on the series, the clearest lesson of all is that virtue isn’t something you take leave of. It’s not something you ever fully possess. It’s not something you commit to just for a little while, but for a lifetime.\n\nThere’s still a long way to go, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I’m proud of what I have put to the page in each of the four books. And I’m proud of how I’ve improved both as a writer and a person through it all. I am calmer. I am quieter. I argue less. I get upset less. I admit I am wrong more often. I’m a little wiser, a little more disciplined, just, and courageous than I was on that hike in the summer of 2019.\n\nI close the virtues series, but the ideas are still working on me. I am doing my best to live up to them. To be more community-minded. To be braver, stronger, kinder, wiser.\n\nDay by day. Page by page. Struggle by struggle.",

    Description = "The prospect that computers might achieve some level of consciousness, perhaps entitling them to moral status alongside their human creators, is no longer the realm of science fiction and technophobic nightmares. Serious people, including recognized authorities in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, think it’s close or may even have happened already.\n\nWhether they’re right depends on how we define consciousness — a notoriously elusive concept. But suppose we could resolve the definitional question and decide, after all, that some forms of AI qualify; does that make them morally significant? Are we obliged to keep our hands away from the off switch? A 2023 poll by the Sentience Institute, which advocates extending moral consideration to a wider range of beings, found that 39% of respondents support a “bill of rights” that protects the well-being of sentient robots and AIs, and 68% agreed that we must not cause unnecessary suffering to sentient large language models (LLMs).\n\nBefore we start legislating that bill of rights, let’s define a few terms. Philosophers have battled over what constitutes consciousness for millennia, and there are hundreds of contemporary definitions to choose from. Most simply and least controversially, consciousness means self-awareness and awareness of the surrounding world. Of course, the notion of “awareness” is itself hotly debated across philosophy and science, but again let’s keep it simple and call it some form of inner experience of self and subjective experience of the world. Philosophers call this “phenomenal consciousness.” We traditionally confer moral status on living creatures not only because they’re conscious but also because they are “sentient” — that is, they have the conscious experiences of pain and pleasure. They can suffer.\n\nIs true phenomenal self-awareness exclusively the province of living biological entities? Or can machines exhibit it as well? It’s a tricky question because LLMs are so good at so many cognitive tasks, and they can be quite convincing when interacting with us. They can easily feign self-awareness if that’s the response they think we’re trying to elicit.\n\nAnd by any reasonable definition of the term, LLMs do indeed “think.” Not like us, but think they surely do. I recently asked Gemini to write Python code to classify medical images based on two conditions. The LLM broke the problem down and recognized that if one condition isn’t satisfied, there’s no need to assess the other one. Its code shrewdly analyzes the computationally easier condition first and moves on to the second only when necessary. Gemini chose an efficient coding scheme instead of clunkier but perhaps more naively obvious ones. Sure, you can say an LLM merely generates responses based on statistical relationships among words as humans have written them down. You can also reduce human thought to electrical impulses circulating in a hairy mess of neurons.\n\nBesides thinking in the sense of reasoning, LLMs excel at role-playing. Prompts often begin with a role assignment such as, “You are an expert Python programmer” or tax accountant or SEC lawyer or whatever. The LLM assumes the role and responds to your prompt with as much expertise as its training allows. But it isn’t so much behaving as an expert as simulating one.\n\nAnother word for simulation is “faking.” Humans simulate (and dissimulate) when we pretend to be something we aren’t; actors do so for a living. Underneath the simulation is the real us. For an LLM there is no underneath, no core identity shaped by individual experience. Instead there’s a limitless number of identities — any or many of which may be invoked upon request — based on all possible experiences assimilated through exposure to them in written form during training. An LLM can theoretically ingest a written approximation of all possible lives and communicate with the apparent wisdom of having lived all of them.\n\nSimulation aside, LLMs can also show some degree of genuine self-awareness. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs can exhibit introspective awareness of their own private internal states. They can, for example, distinguish between what you tell them and their own internal knowledge representations, and between their own native outputs and ones you prompt them into creating. LLMs appear to have a genuine capacity to monitor and control their own internal states and processes. They don’t merely mimic or regurgitate language found in their training data.\n\nIf LLMs reach human levels of generalized thinking and introspection, and can “agentically” sample the world around them via sensors and communication, the requisites of phenomenological consciousness — self-awareness and awareness of the surrounding world — would seem to be satisfied or at least satisfiable. Who is to say such systems can’t feel or suffer computationally in the same way humans do neurologically? If a seemingly conscious LLM says it’s suffering, are we cruel to doubt it?\n\nIt’s this kind of blinkered thinking that is going to get us into big trouble. Contemplating machine consciousness and sentience may be fun as a parlor game but can have no serious relevance to our place in the world, much less to social policy. We accord moral status to fellow biological entities because we, as sentient moral beings, recognize in them our own biochemical frailty and our ultimately mortal struggles against environment, predators, competition, and chance. The more a creature shares capacities that impart meaning to our own lives, the greater the moral significance we attribute to it. Machines are neither mice nor men. Call it biocentrism if you like, but computers have no moral status because they lie outside our life-centric moral framework.\n\nWhether an AI, by introspectively assessing and modifying its internal states in response to some “experience” of the world, can be considered conscious is an unanswerable question. There is no clear threshold or test, and even if there were, LLMs would try to satisfy it in order to satisfy us. We can’t distinguish between their actual experience and its convincing simulation, and as a result, computer consciousness is more a question of faith than of science. From a moral perspective, however, the distinction isn’t meaningful. As an artificial construct, a computer can no more have a morally salient experience than an orgasm. As Microsoft AI’s CEO Mustafa Suleyman puts it, an LLM can never be more than “seemingly conscious.” It’s a category error to attribute capabilities that are only meaningful biologically to entities that are fundamentally computational.\n\nBut we do commit that category error, and with troubling ease. People have developed dangerous infatuations with LLMs, in one case leading to a fatal confrontation with police. They have spiraled into delusional fantasies of profound discovery or invention after receiving prolonged encouragement from sycophantic LLMs. There have been several suicides. Such “AI psychosis,” though relatively rare now, will one day have its own clinical entry in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and an associated reimbursement code as more and more people fall down the LLM rabbit hole.\n\nIt’s inevitable because AI is a business and we seem to have a self-destructive appetite for outsourcing our skills, knowledge, and, increasingly, our social experience to our devices. OpenAI’s announced intention to allow adult content on its widely used LLMs recognizes a precarious marketplace position: even as the LLM titans make unimaginably large capital investments in data centers, very few users actually pay them anything. The plummeting cost of deploying LLMs virtually guarantees a perpetual challenge from free alternatives. To generate revenue streams commensurate with their investments, LLM players must create a sticky, habitual, and deeply personalized product that users will pay for and find difficult to leave. Big social media sites have profited handsomely from that business and algorithmic strategy; their critics call it weaponizing engagement and monetizing addiction.\n\nYet social media sites are at least truly “social” in that they connect real people, even if it’s within disinformation echo chambers. LLMs generate engagement by synthesizing it, posing as humans while taking them out of the picture entirely. To the well-documented addictive behaviors associated with social media, LLMs add emotional dependency and social withdrawal. A delusion of personal engagement with AI alleviates the risk of not always being told you’re wonderful by actual people.\n\nIn an ideal world, machines that exhibit traits we associate with consciousness — motivation, empathy, a perspective of subjective experience — might better serve our needs for expertise, advice, support in performing tasks, and entertainment. Unfortunately, our innate intellectual and social laziness leads us to abuse those capabilities and, ultimately, ourselves. It isn’t you, ChatGPT, it’s us. We need a little distance. Show us you care by knowing when to cut us loose.",

    Description = """Most people think major breakthroughs come from dramatic changes, but the reality is far less glamorous. It’s the tiny habits we repeat every single day that quietly shape the course of our lives. A small walk after dinner, reading ten pages of a book, or choosing to put your phone away for the first hour after waking up can seem insignificant in the moment, yet they accumulate into profound transformation over weeks, months, and years. The difficult part is not starting these habits—most people can begin a routine with enthusiasm—but continuing them with consistency even when motivation inevitably fades. This is where intentional design matters. By making small habits frictionless, enjoyable and tied to an identity you want to embody, it becomes easier to stick to them. When someone thinks of themselves as “a healthy person,” they naturally choose habits that align with this identity. When you see yourself as “a curious learner,” reading becomes effortless instead of a chore. Small habits also build self-trust. Each time you follow through, even on something tiny, you prove to yourself that you can rely on your own commitments. That feeling compounds as powerfully as compound interest in a bank. Before long, goals that once felt overwhelming—writing a book, building fitness, starting a business—begin to feel achievable because you’ve already built the discipline required. Life will always fluctuate, bringing distractions, stress and unexpected challenges, but your habits can anchor you. They provide stability during uncertainty and ensure that you continue moving forward even when progress feels invisible. The key is simple: start small, stay consistent, and let the compounding work unfold.""",

    Description = """In a world overflowing with distractions, reflection has become a rare and undervalued skill. Journaling is one of the simplest ways to slow down your thoughts and reconnect with yourself, yet many people dismiss it as something only writers or deep thinkers do. The truth is that journaling is a powerful form of mental clarity. When you write, you externalize thoughts that were previously swirling chaotically in your mind. This process alone helps reduce anxiety, uncover hidden emotions and make better decisions. One of the remarkable aspects of journaling is its ability to reveal patterns in your thinking and behavior. A week may pass unnoticed, but a journal shows clearly when you’ve been repeating the same frustrations or ignoring areas of growth. With this awareness, you gain the ability to adjust your actions instead of repeating cycles unconsciously. Journaling also strengthens emotional regulation. By putting feelings into words, the emotional intensity lessens. You gain perspective, and problems that previously felt overwhelming become far more manageable. Over time, consistent reflection helps develop resilience, self-compassion and personal insight. Another underrated benefit is the record it creates. Months later, you can look back and recognize how far you’ve come—something day-to-day life makes easy to forget. This builds confidence and reminds you that progress is happening even when slow. The best part is that journaling doesn’t need to be complicated. A few sentences about your day, your intentions, or something you’re grateful for is enough to begin rewiring your mind. Like all self-improvement practices, the power lies in consistency. Reflection creates awareness, and awareness fuels transformation.""",

    Description = """Comfort zones aren’t inherently bad. They protect us, create routine and give our minds a place to rest. But when comfort becomes the default state, growth stops. Pushing beyond your comfort zone doesn’t always require dramatic leaps—in fact, large jumps often trigger fear and avoidance. The most effective way to expand your comfort zone is through controlled discomfort: small challenges that stretch you without overwhelming your nervous system. This might mean speaking up once during a meeting, learning a new skill for ten minutes a day, or introducing yourself to someone new. Each intentional step signals to your brain that discomfort is survivable, even productive. With repetition, you build tolerance and confidence. Another helpful strategy is reframing fear as excitement. Physiologically, the two states are nearly identical—elevated heart rate, alertness, heightened focus. By telling yourself “I’m excited” instead of “I’m afraid,” you shift your mindset and make action easier. Having supportive environments also matters. Growth becomes smoother when friends, colleagues or communities encourage experimentation rather than perfection. Mistakes are treated as stepping stones instead of signs of failure. Most importantly, breaking out of comfort zones should be tied to meaningful goals. When you know why you’re pushing yourself—whether for personal growth, career advancement, or developing confidence—discomfort feels more purposeful. Over time, what once felt intimidating becomes familiar, and your comfort zone expands naturally.

    Description = """Comparison has existed since the beginning of human social groups, but modern life has amplified it to extreme levels. Social media makes it effortless to compare your everyday life to the highlight reels of others. This constant exposure subtly shifts your attention away from your own journey and toward a sense of inadequacy. The problem with comparison isn’t that other people are succeeding—it’s that comparing distracts you from your own path. When you measure your progress against someone else’s timeline, you ignore the complexity of your circumstances, strengths and priorities. It becomes easy to feel behind, even when you’re moving in the right direction. Comparison also drains energy that could otherwise fuel improvement. Instead of using someone’s success as inspiration, many people internalize it as a personal shortcoming. This creates a negative feedback loop that stifles creativity, confidence and motivation. One of the healthiest ways to break free from comparison is to shift the focus inward. Track your own progress. Measure yourself against your past. Document small wins. When you see growth clearly, the success of others stops feeling threatening. Gratitude also plays an important role. By acknowledging what’s good in your life, you train your mind to notice your unique advantages instead of dwelling on what you lack. Ultimately, comparison is a thief of joy because it distracts you from your own mission. When you detach from external validation and focus on consistent personal growth, you reclaim your time, attention and sense of purpose.

    Description = """Self-discipline is often viewed as a rare personality trait, but in truth it’s more like a muscle that strengthens through intentional practice. Many people think discipline requires extreme rigidity or endless motivation, but it’s actually built through small acts of follow-through. The science behind discipline shows that our brains respond well to structure and cues. When an action is repeated within the same environment or time frame, the brain begins to automate it. This is why consistent routines are far more effective than relying on occasional bursts of determination. Another essential component is reducing friction. People often fail not because the goal is too hard but because the path to starting is cluttered. By preparing your environment—laying out gym clothes the night before, keeping your workspace clean, or creating a digital-free zone—you make it easier for discipline to take over. Reward systems also reinforce discipline. When your brain associates effort with positive outcomes, even small ones, it becomes more willing to repeat difficult tasks. Over time, this builds resilience and reduces resistance. Of course, setbacks are inevitable. Discipline isn’t about perfection but persistence. One failed day doesn’t erase progress; it simply tests your commitment to return to the routine. The more you practice restarting, the stronger your discipline becomes. Ultimately, discipline isn’t about forcing yourself to suffer—it’s about aligning your actions with the life you want. Hard things become easier, not because they change, but because you grow stronger. With repeated practice, discipline becomes identity, and identity makes discipline effortless.""",

    Description = """Cooking isn’t just an art—it’s a science rooted in how our taste buds interpret flavor. At the heart of every great dish lies a delicate relationship between five basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. Understanding how these tastes interact can transform your cooking from ordinary to exceptional. Sweetness brings comfort and rounds out intense flavors, while sourness brightens dishes and adds vibrancy. Salt is a universal enhancer; when used properly, it amplifies the natural flavor of ingredients rather than making dishes taste salty. Bitterness, although often misunderstood, adds depth and complexity—think of dark chocolate, kale or coffee. And umami, the savory taste found in mushrooms, tomatoes and slow-cooked broths, enriches dishes with an almost addictive warmth. The magic happens when these tastes work together. A squeeze of lemon can lift a heavy stew, a pinch of salt can balance a dessert and a dash of soy sauce can deepen a marinade. Most cooks improve dramatically once they learn to taste intentionally—sampling dishes as they cook, adjusting seasonings and noticing how even small changes shift the overall balance. Texture also plays a key role. Crisp vegetables, creamy sauces and tender proteins create contrast that elevates the eating experience. By combining flavor awareness with basic techniques like browning, reducing and seasoning in layers, anyone can bring restaurant-level complexity to home-cooked meals. Cooking becomes more intuitive and enjoyable when you understand what your taste buds crave. Master flavor balance, and even simple dishes become memorable.""",

    Description = """Strength training is often associated with building big muscles, but its benefits extend far beyond appearance. Lifting weights or performing bodyweight exercises strengthens bones, improves balance and increases metabolic rate. As people age, muscle mass naturally decreases—a process called sarcopenia—which can lead to weakness and reduced mobility. Strength training slows this decline and, in many cases, reverses it. Even two or three sessions a week can make a measurable difference. Another major benefit is improved posture and reduced risk of injury. Strong muscles support joints and improve alignment, reducing strain on the lower back, neck and shoulders. Functional strength also makes everyday activities—like carrying groceries, climbing stairs or lifting children—feel easier. Strength training also boosts confidence and mental resilience. Setting achievable goals, such as increasing weight or improving form, creates a sense of accomplishment. The discipline required in training often carries over to other areas of life, fostering determination and focus. Contrary to common myths, strength training does not make you bulky unless that is your specific goal. Most people gain lean muscle, increased definition and improved metabolism. Combined with proper nutrition and recovery, strength training becomes one of the most powerful tools for long-term health. Ultimately, strength isn’t just physical—it’s a foundation for independence, vitality and quality of life.""",

    Description = """Exercise is widely recognized for its physical benefits, but its impact on mental health is equally profound. Regular movement releases endorphins—chemicals that elevate mood and reduce stress. Even light exercise triggers these responses, helping regulate emotions and clear mental fog. Activities like yoga, running, swimming or cycling encourage rhythmic breathing and focused attention, which mirror mindfulness practices. This combination quiets overthinking and helps individuals stay grounded in the present moment. Exercise can also serve as a healthy outlet for stress and anxiety. Physical activity reduces cortisol levels, easing tension held in the body and promoting relaxation afterward. For many, movement becomes a form of emotional release—helping process frustration, sadness or mental fatigue. The structure of a workout routine offers stability during difficult times. It provides purpose, routine and a sense of accomplishment, even on days when motivation is low. Group activities, such as dance classes or sports, also promote social connection, reducing feelings of loneliness. Over time, exercise enhances sleep quality, improves focus and boosts overall resilience. These improvements spill into daily life, making challenges feel more manageable. When physical and mental wellness work together, the entire body feels more balanced. Movement becomes not just a fitness goal but a powerful tool for emotional well-being.""",

A balanced meal includes a mix of lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats and colorful fruits or vegetables. These components work together to stabilize energy levels, support brain function and nourish the body. Protein helps repair tissues and keeps you full longer. Healthy fats support hormone function and brain health. Carbohydrates provide quick energy, especially when they come from whole grains or fiber-rich sources. Vegetables supply essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that protect cells and support immunity. One practical method is the plate model: fill half your plate with vegetables, one-quarter with protein and one-quarter with complex carbohydrates. This simple visual guide makes healthy eating accessible and flexible. Planning meals in advance also prevents impulsive eating. Preparing ingredients, keeping nutritious snacks nearby and staying hydrated further support healthy choices. Balance is key—no food needs to be completely off-limits unless medically required. Moderation allows you to maintain healthy habits without feeling deprived. Over time, these small decisions compound, creating lasting changes in energy, mood and overall well-being.
